Even children suffer from this\\ndisease. That is why I feel that you are fortunate that your disease hasbeen diagnosed at right time. This is one of the most widely studied,researched and advance areas in the medical field. At present there isno cure in any of the PATHIES for this disease. But with modern medicaladvancement you can definitely live near normal healthy life. We arehere to add life to your life. We care for you and for your diabetes. Yourcooperation is mandatory because A DIABETIC WHO KNOWS THE MOSTABOUT HIS DISEASE FACES LEAST PROBLEMS. In any disease it is saidthat half the battle is won by confidence and I intend to give youconfidence in this booklet, confidence to live with the disease gracefullyand confidence to tackle your problems intelligently.\\nLet us start with the basic question i.e. WHAT IS DIABETES?\\nGlucose is essential for providing energy for normal body\\nfunctions. In diabetes the blood glucose levels are increased due torelative or absolute deficiency of insulin. Insulin is a hormone. A Hormoneis a chemical secreted by one of the glands in our body. This gland issituated in abdomen and is known as pancreas. Insulin acts as agatekeeper that allows entry of glucose into the cell.\\nIf the amount of insulin is abnormal or the function of insulin\\nis at fault excess of glucose accumulates in the body with harmfuleffects on the cells of various organs. Diabetes is a metabolic disorderin which body is unable to handle glucose for its energy requirements.As we have already discussed, insulin is essential for entry of glucose into the cell that is why\\n1) Cells can not adequately utilise glucose, so\\n2) Body tries to produce more glucose (gluconeogenisis).\\n3'),\n",

There are two major types of diabetes. The first type i.e.insulin dependent diabetes. It can be treated only with insulin as themain drug. This is common in younger age group of patients. Thesecond type is non-insulin dependent diabetes (Type II). This is morecommon in India. This usually affects people above 40 years of age. Thisgroup can be managed with diet, exercises and oral medications. Somepatients in this group may require insulin sometime later in life.\\nThe comparison of two types of diabetes is shown in following\\ntable.\\nFEAFEAFEAFEAFEATURETURETURETURETURE TYPE I (IDDM)TYPE I (IDDM)TYPE I (IDDM)TYPE I (IDDM)TYPE I (IDDM) TYPE II (NIDDM)TYPE II (NIDDM)TYPE II (NIDDM)TYPE II (NIDDM)TYPE II (NIDDM)\\nAge of Onset Younger age group Above 30-35 years\\nInsulin level in Negligible Decreased or High\\nblood\\nBodyweight Underweight or Overweight or\\nNormal Normal\\nUsual Treatment Insulin Oral and InsulinInheritance Less Significant More Significant\\n4'),\n",

These patientsrequire medication either in the form of oral drugs orinsulin injections.\\nDiet and exercise need to be continued as a part of treatment\\nof diabetes. Basically, oral medication is of following major types:sulfonylurea (available commercially as daonil, Glynase, euglucon anddimicron) and biguinides (marketed as Glyciphase, Walaphase). Thesehave different modes of action. The doctor will decide the suitable typeand dose of medicine. You may need one or more tablets if the controlof your blood glucose is not possible by following a healthy eating planor by being active. These tablets lower blood glucose, in different ways.For example, sulfonylurea lowers blood glucose by helping the pancreasmake more insulin. Sulfonylureas have to be taken half an hour beforefood. Whereas, biguanides reduce blood glucose by decreasing the liver’sproduction of glucose. It also causes the muscle to use glucose moreefficiently. The two other new types of medicines like Acarbose andinsulin sensitizers work in other ways. Acarbose reduces absorption ofglucose from intestine. It has to be taken just before first bite of lunchand dinner. These medicines have specific indications.

Crabtree, PhD.  \\nDiabetes mellitus, or simply diabetes , is a chronic disease affecting about 25.8 million people in the United States \\nmaking it the seventh leading cause of death.  \\nWhat is Diabetes?  \\nDiabetes is a met abolic disorder in which there are high levels of sugar in the blood, a condition called \\nhyperglycemia. Under normal conditions, food is broken down to glucose which then enters the bloodstream and \\nacts as fuel for the body. The p ancreas produces a hormone  called insulin which helps to carry glucose from the \\nbloodstream into muscle, fat and liver where it can be used as fuel. Diabetics are not able to move this sugar out \\nof the bloodstream because of two primary reasons: 1) their pancreas do es not produce e nough insulin and/or 2) \\ntheir cells do  not respond normally to insulin , a condition called insulin resistance . This is why  people with \\ndiabetes have high blood sugar  levels .  \\n  \\n \\nTypes of diabetes:  \\n1) Type 1 diabetes (T1D) / Juvenile diabetes/ Insulin dependen t diabetes:  T1D affects both adults and \\nchildren at any age and occurs when the person’s pancreas stop producing insulin  due to destruction of \\nthe pancreatic beta cells or by inactivity of these insulin -producing cells . Affected individuals depend on \\ndaily  injections of insulin  to maintain normal blood glucose levels . The causes of T1D  are not entirely \\nunderstood however; scientists believe that both genetic and environmental factors are involved.  \\n2) Type 2 diabetes/ Non -insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( T2D or NIDDM):  This is the most common \\nform of diabetes that most often occu rs in adulthood. However, because of increased obesity rates and \\nsedentary lifestyles,  teens and young adults are also being diagnosed with T2D or the precursor, pre -Source: http://www.natural -homeremedies.com/blog/top -8-risk-factors -of-type-2-diabetes/  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataset\\\\DIABETES.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='diabetes. In T2D, fat, muscle and liver cells do  not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin \\nresistance. As a result, blood sugar cannot enter these cells to be stored for energy and build s up in the \\nblood. Insulin resistance is a gradual process that develop s slowly over time.  \\n3) Gestational diabetes:  This refers to diabetes that is first diagnosed during pregnancy. As many as  eight \\nout of 100 pregnant women in the U.S develop gestational diabetes. Weight gain and changing hormones \\nthat occur during pregnancy  can impair insulin function,  resulting in high blood sugar. This form of \\ndiabetes usually disappears after pregnancy, however, women who have had gestational diabetes have a \\n40-60% chance of developing T2D within 5 to 10 years.  \\n \\nRisk factors for Diabetes:  The following factors contribute to the risk of developing diabetes - \\nType 1 diabetes –  \\n1) Family history of diabetes  \\n2) Disease of the pancreas  \\n3) Infection or illness that affects the pancreas  \\n \\nType 2 diabetes –  \\n1) Obesity  \\n2) Family history of diabetes  \\n3) History of g estational diabetes  \\n4) Ethnic background - African Americans, Native americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans \\nhave a higher risk for  developing diabetes.  \\n5) Old age  \\n6) Hypertension  \\n \\nGestational diabetes – \\n1) Family history of diabetes  \\n2) Being overweight before  becoming pregnant  \\n3) Belonging to a high risk ethnic group (as mentioned above)  \\n4) Having gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy  \\n5) Giving birth to a baby over 9 pounds  \\n \\n \\nSymptoms:  \\n \\n1.

Misdiagnosis is also common [16].\\nTh e most important factor leading to the development of COPD is tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoke \\ncauses destruction of lung tissue and obstruction of the small airways, leading to emphysema and bronchitis, which are the main diseases of COPD. \\nIndoor smoke, inhaled occupational exposures through farming, mining, construction, transportation \\nand manufacturing pose risks for COPD globally. Other risks for COPD include genetic syndromes, such as α\\n1-antitrypsin defi  ciency, outdoor air pollution and other diseases that involve the airways, such as \\nchronic asthma and TB [17]. Smoke exposure in childhood may predispose to the development of chronic lung disease in adult life [18]. \\nPrevention\\nReduction of smoking is the fi  rst and most important priority in preventing COPD. Th  is measure will also \\ngreatly reduce the morbidity and mortality of other lung diseases.

Although it strikes all ages, races and ethnicities, \\nwide variation exists in diff  erent countries and in diff  erent groups within the same country. It is the most \\ncommon chronic disease in children and is more severe in children in non-affl   uent countries. In these \\nsettings, underdiagnosis and under-treatment are common, and eff  ective medicines may not be available \\nor aff  ordable. Th  e burden of asthma is also greater in urban settings. It is one of the most frequent reasons \\nfor preventable hospital admissions among children [20, 21]. Asthma causes about 180 000 deaths worldwide each year [22]. In some studies, asthma accounts for over 30% of all paediatric hospitalisations and nearly 12% of readmissions within 180 days of discharge [21]. \\nTh e cause of the increase in global prevalence of as thma is not well understood. Genetic predisposition, \\nexposure to environmental allergens, air pollution, dietary factors and abnormal immunological responses \\nall promote the development of asthma. Th  e timing and level of exposure to allergens and irritants may \\nbe crucial factors leading to the development of disease. Early viral infections and passive tobacco smoke exposure have been associated with the development of asthma in young children. Airborne allergens and irritants associated with asthma occur in the workplace and can lead to chronic and debilitating disease if the exposure persists. \\nPrevention\\nTh e cause of most asthma is unknown and thus its prevention is problematic. People who smoke and have \\nasthma have a much more rapid decline in lung function than those who do not smoke. Avoiding smoking during pregnancy and avoidance of passive smoke exposure aft  er birth can reduce asthma severity in children. \\nOccupational asthma has taught us that early removal of allergens or irritants may ablate or reduce the disease.\\nTreatment\\nAsthma is a generally a lifelong disease that is not curable, but eff  ective treatment can alleviate the symptoms. \\nInhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone of eff  ective asthma treatment. When used appropriately, i.e. \\ntaken regularly with a spacer or other device to assist  inhalation, these medicines can decrease the severity \\nand frequency of symptoms of asthma. Th  ey also reduce the need for reliever inhalers (rapid-acting \\nbronchodilators) and the frequency of severe episodes (“exacerbations”) requiring urgent medical care, emergency room visits and hospitalisations.

Since these deaths are preventable with adequate medical care, a much higher proportion of them occur in low-income countries. Pneumonia is the most common serious respiratory infection. In children under 5 years of age, pneumonia accounts for 18% of all deaths, or more than 1.3 million annually [6]; pneumonia kills far more than HIV or malaria [24]. Risk factors for pneumonia include \\nliving in crowded conditions, malnutrition, lack of immunisation, HIV and exposure to tobacco or indoor smoke. \\nIn Africa, pneumonia is one of the most frequent reasons for adults being admitted to hospital; one in ten \\nof these patients die from their disease. It is several-f old higher in the elderly and HIV-infected individuals. \\nStreptococcus pneumoniae  remains the most frequent bacterial cause of pneumonia; HIV infection increases \\nthe risk of pneumonia caused by this organism twenty-fold [25]. Pneumonia can also lead to chronic respiratory disease, such as bronchiectasis.\\nViral respiratory infections can occur in epidemics and can spread rapidly within communities across the \\nglobe. Every year, infl  uenza causes respiratory tract infections in 5–15% of the population and severe illness \\nin 3–5 million people [10]. In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a previously unrecognised coronavirus, rapidly spread throughout th e world. Its lethality mobilised international eff  orts \\nthat rapidly identifi  ed the cause and the method of spread. Stringent infection control measures reduced its \\nspread and were so eff  ective that no further cases were identifi  ed [26]. Th  is is in stark contrast to the 1918 \\ninfl uenza pandemic that claimed the lives of between 30 and 150 million persons.\\nPrevention\\nVaccination is one of the greatest achievements of public health. Primary prevention strategies for respiratory infections are based on immunisation programmes that have been developed for both viruses and bacteria. Bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia; S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus infl  uenzae type b \\nmost frequently cause severe pneumonia in children. Vaccines are eff  ective against these agents, as well as measles and pertussis (whooping cough). Th  e infl  uenza vaccine is eff  ective in preventing infl  uenza in adults 14 Forum of International Respiratory Societies'),\n",

Th  e S. pneumoniae conjugate vaccine is highly eff  ective in reducing pneumonia \\nin children, but this vaccine is still not available as part of a national expanded programme for \\nimmunisation in many low-income countries. \\nChildhood respiratory disease can be prevented or ameliorated by several basic measures: \\nimproving childhood nutrition; promoting breastfeeding; ensuring comprehensive immunisation; improving living conditions to prevent crowding; avoiding tobacco smoke exposure; reducing indoor air pollution; and treating HIV and preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission.\\nTreatment\\nMost bacterial respiratory infections are treatable with antibiotics and most viral infections are self-limited. Y et millions of people die of pneumonia. Th  e failure to prevent these deaths largely \\nresults from lack of access to healthcare or the inability of the healthcare system to care for these individuals.\\nTh e most eff  ective way to manage these diseases is through standard case management. Case \\nmanagement is defi  ned as “a collaborative process of assessment, planning, facilitation, care \\ncoordination, evaluation, and advocacy for options and services to meet an individual’s and \\nfamily’s comprehensive health needs through communication and available resources to promote quality cost-eff  ective outcomes” [27]. \\nFor childhood pneumonia, this involves a standard approach to diagnosis and treatment, as has been developed by the WHO in the Integrated Ma nagement of Childhood  Illness programme. \\nTh e contribution of case management is well illustrated in the Child Lung Health services \\ndeveloped in Malawi, in collaboration with Th  e Union. In this resource-limited country, adopting \\na standardised case management programme, training health workers and developing the infrastructure to implement the programme ste adily improved the outcome for children under \\n5 years of age with pneumonia [28]. Th  e cornerstone of pneumonia management is appropriate \\ndiagnosis and use of antibiotics.\\nControl or elimination\\nVaccines are essential for the control and elimination of disease. New conjugate vaccines must be available as part of expanded programmes for immunisation in all countries. Development of improved vaccines with broader coverage is needed to control or eliminate specifi  c infections.\\nAntibiotics have made most bacterial pneumonia easily curable. As with other diseases in which the causes are known and cures are available, key eff  orts must be in improving the availability and delivery of quality healthcare and medicine.

TB killed \\n1.4 million people and took an extraordinary high toll in parts of Africa. About 80% of global HIV-TB cases occurred in Africa, where TB is the leading cause of HIV-related mortality [30]. TB is contagious (airborne) and therefore clusters in countries and regions; 22 countries account for 80% of existing cases of tuberculosis worldwide [4]. Multidrug-resistant TB is increasing and approached 60 000 cases in 2011 [4]. Eastern Europe has been particularly hard-hit by drug-resistant disease.\\nTh e good news is that the intense multinational eff  orts for TB control of the past decade have paid \\ndividends. New cases are falling at a rate of about 2.2% per year and mortality has dropped 41% since 1990 \\n[4]. New diagnostic tests and drugs are becoming available and considerable progress is being made in understanding the bacterium and developing vaccines. Unfortunately, this progress masks other persistent serious problems and regional variations.\\nIndividuals become infected by inhaling tuberculous bacteria. TB usually develops subtly so that, initially, \\npeople may not know they are infected. Only about one in 10 infected but otherwise healthy people develop symptomatic disease, although this rate is much higher in young children and people with HIV or certain other illnesses. Th  e disease lies dormant because the infection is contained by the body’s immune \\nsystem, but can become active at any point in the person’s lifetime. Active disease usually develops slowly so that individuals may cough and spread the disease without knowing it. With the ease and frequency of international travel, spread to other people is easy. No one is safe from TB until the world is safe from TB.\\nTB is a particular problem in children, where diagnosis is more diffi   cult. Infants and young children are \\nespecially susceptible to developing severe or disseminated TB. TB can strain national healthcare systems \\nbecause of the eff  ort and cost needed for contact tracing and treatment, especially if the bacteria are \\nresistant to commonly used drugs.\\nPrevention\\nIn no disease is the phrase “treatment is prevention” truer than with TB. Th  e factors promoting the spread \\nof infection relate to the chance that an uninfected individual is exposed to those with infectious TB: the more cases in the community, the more likely it is that an individual will become infected. Factors promoting the development of disease in infected individuals relate to the function of the immune system. Th  e most potent factor is infection with HIV , but other conditions that aff  ect immunity, such as certain \\nmedications and the presence of poorly controlled diabetes, increase the risk of developing active disease.16 Forum of International Respiratory Societies'),\n",

Th  e treatment of HIV also \\nreduces TB.\\nTh e current vaccine, Bacille-Calmette-Guérin (BCG), is largely ineff  ective for \\npulmonary TB, but off  ers some protection against disseminated TB. However, \\nresearch centres around the world are working on developing new vaccines      \\nfor TB.\\nTreatment\\nMost cases of TB can be cured if diagnosed early and treated appropriately. However, TB is a complicated disease that can be diffi   cult to diagnose and \\ntreat; there are many nuances to its management. TB is best managed by a standardised approach that is based on evidence derived from clinical trials. Th e long duration of therapy (usually 6 months with three or four drugs in \\nuncomplicated cases) makes adherence to treatment challenging, especially in individuals who are taking other drugs for chronic diseases, such as HIV . Failure to take the full course of prescribed drugs may result in relapse with drug-resistant disease, which is more diffi   cult to treat and poses a risk to others \\nwho could be infected by that person. For this reason, supervised or directly observed therapy is recommended to ensure adherence throughout the course of treatment for TB. \\nTo complement the standard case management promoted by the WHO through \\nits Stop TB Department, the Tuberculosis Coalition for Technical Assistance developed a document to engage all providers in the best care for TB patients wherever they may be found [31].\\nControl or elimination\\nMany areas of TB research are producing encouraging results. Diagnosis is oft  en \\ndiffi  cult because it has generally relied on observing bacteria microscopically \\nin the sputum. New diagnostic technologies, such as GeneXpert MTB/RIF®, which analyse sputum for mycobacterial DNA, are signifi  cantly more sensitive \\nthan microscopic sputum smear examination. In addition, DNA technology can detect drug resistance. Th  ese tools are becoming available to high-prevalence \\ncountries where drug resistance is a major problem. Scaling up this technology and enabling treatment for drug resistance are major challenges.\\nIf fi rst-line (standard) antituberculous medicines cannot be used because of \\ndrug resistance, drug intolerance or drug interactions, treatment must extend \\nmuch longer. Treating drug-resistant disease costs much more and the chance of cure is much less. Fortunately, several new drugs are on the horizon for drug-resistant disease. Shorter-course therapy for both sensitive and resistant TB is urgently needed to further reduce the prevalence of this disease. Shorter duration of therapy is also needed for latent TB. A recent study showed that the treatment with only 12 weekly doses of medicine, directly observed over 3 months, was as good as the current 9-month daily regimen [32]. Public health eff orts to reduce the TB burden include the WHO’s “3Is” initiative (intensifi  ed \\ncase fi  nding, isoniazid preventive therapy and improved infection control) [4].'),\n",

Lung cancer is also the most common cause of \\ncancer death, killing 1.37 million per year, or about 18% of the total cancer deaths [9]. Lung cancer has the highest fatality rate of all major cancers; its ratio of mortality to incidence is 0.86 [9]. In the USA, lung cancer causes more deaths than breas t, colon and prostate cancer combined.\\nTobacco smoke is the cause of most cases of lung cancer. Many components of tobacco smoke mutate DNA and are carcinogenic. Th  ese eff  ects correlate with the amount and duration of smoking. Since \\ndamage accumulates over time, lung cancer occurs years aft  er people begin smoking. As smoking rates \\nrise, lung cancer rates follow.\\nAlthough most lung cancer is associated with sm oking, it can occur in non-smokers, especially in those \\nwho are passively exposed to tobacco smoke. Among those who do not smoke and do not live with those \\nwho do, exposure to smoke from biomass fuel is a cause of lung cancer. Exposure to radon, asbestos and other environmental and workplace elements also causes lung cancer. Although asbestos is now banned in \\n52 countries, it is still in the environment in buildings and previous manufacturing sites. Some countries where its use is banned still produce and market it to poorer countries – this must stop.\\nPrevention\\nLung cancer is largely preventable through smoking prevention and cessation. At the beginning of the 20th century, lung cancer and smoking were rare. As the number of smokers grew, the number of lung cancer cases grew about 20 years later. Smoking began to decrease in the last third of the 20th century in certain countries and lung cancer is now slowly declining in those countries. Public programmes that reduce smoking are urgently needed to halt the rise in respiratory cancers in nations where smoking has increased because the incidence of lung cancer w ill also increase in those countries.\\nEnvironmental causes of lung cancer, such as radon and asbestos, can be monitored and reduced. Lung cancer can also occur in non-smokers without known en vironmental exposure. Research is needed to \\ndetermine other causes of lung cancer.\\nTreatment\\nTh e care of patients with lung cancer is complex.

Patients with lung cancer and \\nHIV infection tend to be relatively young but they usually present with advanced disease and have a poor prognosis. Treatment with chemotherapy in people with HIV may be diffi  cult because of drug interactions and toxicity.\\nIdentifying and treating early cancer is a potential lifesaving strategy. A national lung cancer screening trial undertaken in the USA was the largest (53 454 participants) randomised trial of a single cancer-screening test in the history of US medicine. Th  e study randomly assigned current and former \\nsmokers to plain chest radiography (control) or low-dose chest computed tomography (intervention) yearly for 3 years and followed them for another 3.5 years.

Identifying and ameliorating the \\nfactors that cause or promote respiratory diseases can prevent them, especially because respiratory diseases \\nare oft  en linked to the environment. Respiratory conditions are preventable to a greater degree than diseases \\nin any other system. Th  e cost of prevention is only a fraction of the cost of treatment. Because preventing and \\ncombating respiratory disease is so cost-eff  ective, targeting respiratory diseases represents a “best buy” , as \\ndescribed by the WHO [33].\\nBreathing unhealthy air is a cause or contributor to most respiratory conditions. Th  e most common sources of \\nunhealthy air are tobacco smoke, indoor air pollution from burning solid fuels, unhealthy air in the workplace, \\nair pollution from traffi   c and industrial sources, air containing microbes, and air with toxic particles or fumes.\\nTh e fi rst step in preventing lung disease is reduction of tobacco use. Smoking was estimated to be responsible \\nfor one in seven deaths in men and one in 15 deaths in women globally in 2004. It is projected that as many as 1 billion people will die from tobacco smoking in the 21st century [34]. Of these deaths, the greatest proportion is due to respiratory diseases, including lung cancers. In the USA, current smokers are 25 times more likely to die of lung cancer than those who never smoked [35]. Th  e rate of death from all causes is three \\ntimes higher in smokers than non-smokers and life expectancy is shortened by 10 years in smokers [36]. In Europe, the total health cost of tobacco is about €544 billion annually, which represents about 5% of the European Union GDP [37]. \\nTobacco smoking is a global problem that can be solved. Intensive campaigns in western Europe and North \\nand South America have decreased the number of smokers in several countries, but the tobacco industry \\nmoved its target to susceptible populations in eastern Europe, Asia and developing countries to increase sales of its products. An estimated 350 million Chinese smoke an average of 11 cigarettes per day, a level of smoking that has not been seen in western countries in 50 years. Passive smoke exposure also leads to respiratory disease. Children who are exposed to tobacco smoke before birth (from a smoking pregnant mother) or as infants have a greater risk of developing wheezing-associated illnesses, pneumonia and asthma.\\nTh e fi rst international treaty developed for purposes of health was the WHO’s Framework Convention on \\nTobacco Control [38].

Eff  ective \\nstrategies, termed MPOWER [34], have been developed by the WHO Tobacco-Free Initiative to support \\nimplementation of the Framework to prevent and reduce smoking and the demand for tobacco products. FIRS calls on all governments, communities, healthcare practitioners and individuals to promote these eff ective preventive measures that have reduced tobacco consumption in many countries. Much, however, \\nremains to be done, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, to mitigate the pernicious impact of tobacco smoking.\\nPoor indoor air quality is an important contributor to respiratory disease. About 50% of all households in the \\nworld and 90% of rural households use solid fuels, exposing 2–3 billion people to noxious smoke [39]. Th  e \\nWHO estimates that 1.6 million deaths and 38.5 million DALYs per year can be attributed to indoor smoke. Most disease and death attributable to exposure to poor indoor air quality occurs in women and children, especially in low-income families [40]. Exposure to indoor smoke used for heating and cooking leads to COPD, lung cancer and, in children, pneumonia and asthma [41].\\nPeople with lung disease are particularly susceptible to the eff  ects of outdoor air pollution. Increased \\nconcentrations of airborne fi  ne particles are associated with incr eased hospital admissions and deaths [42–\\n44]. It is estimated that poor air quality in Europe leads to an average loss of 8.6 months of life expectancy \\n[45]. Th  ere is a growing body of evidence that air pollution aff  ects the unborn child, leading to enhanced \\nsusceptibility to infectious, respiratory and cardiovasc ular disease [46]. Children, especially those with chronic \\nlung disease, are also more susceptible to the adverse eff  ects of air pollution [47]. Th  e environmental risks are \\ngreater in low- and middle-income countries and among the disadvantaged and low socioeconomic sections of society. Th  e respiratory societies of the world believe that everyone has the right to breathe clean air [45] \\nand we ask lawmakers to enact and enforce clean air standards in all countries. Th  e health benefi  ts of clean \\nair policies are far reaching. In one large urban area, it was estimated that complying with current standards would reduce the annual death toll by 1 200 deaths per year, reduce the hospitalisations for heart and lung diseases by 600 per year, reduce the cases of chronic bronchitis in adults by 1 900 per year, reduce the cases of acute bronchitis in children by 12 100 per year, and reduce asthma attacks in children and adults by 18 700 per year [48]. Greater improvements in air quality would yield greater benefi  ts. According to the WHO, \\n“Reductions in air pollution over the past two decades have been shown to be associated with increases in life expectancy in the USA and improved respiratory health” [45]. Legislation and political action on clean air makes a diff  erence. \\nAppropriate nutrition and physical activity are critical for health. Both malnutrition and obesity contribute to respiratory diseases. In western societies, obesity is linked with obstructive sleep apnoea, asthma, heart disease and diabetes. Malnutrition is an important risk factor for childhood pneumonia and severe illness.\\nPrevention of respiratory disease entails strengthening healthcare systems, u sing established guidelines for \\nhealth promotion and disease prevention, training medical personnel and educating the populace.\\nTreatment and cure\\nOnce disease occurs, the goal is to lessen its eff  ects and to cure it, if possible. Reducing its eff  ects is best \\naccomplished by early detection, prompt diagnosis and early eff  ective treatment. Successful treatment \\nis based on sound medical evidence, is cost-eff  ective and is generally in accordance with standardised \\nguidelines. Patients and healthcare workers can manage diseases better if they are properly trained \\nand resources are available. Th  e WHO, FIRS members and other respiratory societies have developed \\nrecommendations for standards of care for specifi  c clinical conditions.

Several FIRS member societies have crea ted training programmes. Nearly two decades ago, \\nthe American Th  oracic Society developed the Methods in Clinical and Operational Research (MECOR) \\nprogramme in Latin America to increase the numbers of public health, academic and clinical leaders to facilitate research and its application to public health and healthcare related to respiratory diseases.

Th  e Asociación Latinoamericana de Tórax has now taken over the courses in Latin \\nAmerica. Th  e Pan African Th  oracic Society has developed similar courses that have operated since 2007. \\nTh e Union has many programmes for operational research and management training. Administration is an \\nimportant component of the healthcare system that is oft  en ignored. Th  e European Respiratory Society has \\nsought to improve respiratory care in Europe by developing a Europe-wide curriculum and examination, Harmonised Education in Respiratory Medicine for European Specialists (HERMES), which is now used by many jurisdictions as an authorised postgraduate examination in respiratory medicine. Th  e American \\nCollege of Chest Physicians off  ers dedicated courses, attended by participants from around the world, \\nspecifi  cally designed to fortify the skills necessary for subspecialty certifi  cation in pulmonary medicine. \\nTh e other main tool to reduce respiratory diseases lies in research.

In the United States, heart disease is the #1\\nkiller of both women and men. It affects many people at midlife, as well as in old age. It also can happen to those who “feel fine.”Consider these facts: \\n■Each year, 500,000 Americans die of heart disease, and approx-imately half of them are women.\\n■As early as age 45, a man’s risk of heart disease begins to rise significantly.

This guidebook will help you find out your own riskof heart disease and take steps to prevent it.\\n“But,” you may still be thinking, “I take pretty good care of myself.\\nI’m unlikely to get heart disease.” Yet a recent national survey showsthat only 3 percent of U.S. adults practice all of the “Big Four”habits that help to prevent heart disease: eating a healthy diet, getting regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, andavoiding smoking. Many young people are also vulnerable. Arecent study showed that about two-thirds of teenagers already haveat least one risk factor for heart disease.\\nEvery risk factor counts. Research shows that each individual risk\\nfactor greatly increases the chances of developing heart disease.Moreover, the worse a particular risk factor is, the more likely youare to develop heart disease. For example, if you have high bloodpressure, the higher it is, the greater your chances of developingheart disease, including its many serious consequences.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataset\\\\healthyheart.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='What Is Heart Disease? \\nCoronary heart disease—often simply called heart disease—occurs\\nwhen the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle becomehardened and narrowed due to a buildup of plaque on the arteries’inner walls. Plaque is the accumulation of fat, cholesterol, and othersubstances. As plaque continues to build up in the arteries, bloodflow to the heart is reduced.\\nHeart disease can lead to a heart attack. A heart attack happens\\nwhen an artery becomes totally blocked with plaque, preventingvital oxygen and nutrients from getting to the heart. A heart attackcan cause permanent damage to the heart muscle.\\nHeart disease is one of several cardiovascular diseases, which are\\ndisorders of the heart and blood vessel system. Other cardiovasculardiseases include stroke, high blood pressure, and rheumatic heartdisease.\\nSome people aren’t too concerned about heart disease because they\\nthink it can be “cured” with surgery. This is a myth.\\nHeart disease is a lifelong condition: Once you get it,\\nyou’ll always have it. It’s true that procedures such as\\nangioplasty and bypass surgery can help blood and\\noxygen flow more easily to the heart. But the arter-\\nies remain damaged, which means you are still more\\nlikely to have a heart attack. What’s more, the\\ncondition of your blood vessels will steadily\\nworsen unless you make changes in your\\ndaily habits and control your risk factors.\\nMany people die of complications\\nfrom heart disease, or become \\npermanently disabled. That’s\\nwhy it is so vital to take action to \\nprevent this disease.3What You Need To Know About Heart DiseaseWhat You Need To Know\\nAbout Heart Disease\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataset\\\\healthyheart.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='4\\nWho Is at Risk?\\nRisk factors are conditions or habits that make a person more likely\\nto develop a disease. They can also increase the chances that anexisting disease will get worse. Important risk factors for heart dis-ease that you can do something about are cigarette smoking, highblood pressure, high blood cholesterol, overweight, physical inactivity, and diabetes. Recent research shows that more than 95 percent of those who die from heart disease have at least one of these major risk factors.\\nCertain risk factors, such as getting older, can’t be changed. After\\nmenopause, women are more likely to develop heart disease. Forboth women and men, middle age is a time of increasing riskbecause people are more likely to develop heart disease risk factorsduring this stage of life.\\nFamily history of early heart disease is another risk factor that can’t\\nbe changed. If your father or brother had a heart attack before age55, or if your mother or sister had one before age 65, you are morelikely to get heart disease.\\nWhile certain risk factors cannot be changed, it is important to \\nrealize that you dohave control over many others. Regardless of\\nyour age or family history, you can take important steps to loweryour risk of heart disease.\\nHow Risk Works\\nIt may be tempting to believe that doing just one healthy thing willtake care of your heart disease risk. For example, you may hopethat if you walk or swim regularly, you can still eat a lot of fattyfoods and stay fairly healthy. Not true. To protect your heart, it isvital to make changes that address each and every risk factor youhave. You can make the changes gradually, one at a time. But mak-ing them is very important.\\nWhile each risk factor increases your risk of heart disease, having\\nmore than one risk factor is especially serious. That’s because riskfactors tend to “gang up” and worsen each other’s effects. Forexample, if you have high blood cholesterol and you smoke, yourheart disease risk increases enormously. The message is clear: Youneed to take heart disease risk seriously, and the best time to reducethat risk is now.Your Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Your physician can be an important partner in helping you set and reach goals for hearthealth. But don’t wait for your doctor to mention heart disease orits risk factors. Many physicians don’t routinely bring up the topic,especially with their female patients.

What follows is a guide to the most important risk factorsfor heart disease and how each of them affects your health.\\nSmoking\\nSmoking is “the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States,” according to the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC). People who smoke are up to six times morelikely to suffer a heart attack than nonsmokers, and the risk increas-es with the number of cigarettes smoked each day. Smoking can also shorten a healthy life, because smokers are likely to suffer aheart attack or other major heart problem at least 10 years soonerthan nonsmokers.\\nBut heart disease is far from the only health risk faced by smokers.\\nSmoking also raises the risk of stroke and greatly increases thechances of developing lung cancer. Smoking is also linked withmany other types of cancer, including cancers of the mouth, urinarytract, kidney, and cervix. Smoking also causes most cases of chronicobstructive lung disease, which includes bronchitis and emphysema.If you live or work with others, your secondhand smoke can causenumerous health problems in those individuals. A recent studyshows a 60-percent increased risk of heart disease for nonsmokerswho are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke.\\nCurrently, 25 percent of American men and 20 percent of American\\nwomen are smokers. Even more disturbing, 26 percent of highschool seniors smoke. In young people, smoking can interfere withlung growth and cause more frequent and severe respiratory illnesses,in addition to heart disease and cancer risks.

Low-tar and low-nicotine \\ncigarettes do not lessen the risks of heart disease or other smoking-related diseases. The only safe and healthful course is not to smoke atall. (For tips on quitting, see “You CanStop Smoking” on page 76.) \\nHigh Blood Pressure  \\nHigh blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is another major\\nrisk factor for heart disease, as well as for kidney disease and con-gestive heart failure. High blood pressure is also the most importantrisk factor for stroke. Even slightly high blood pressure levelsincrease your risk for these conditions.\\nNew research shows that at least 65 million adults in the United\\nStates have high blood pressure—a 30-percent increase over the lastseveral years. Equally worrisome, blood pressure levels haveincreased substantially for American children and teens, whichincreases their risk of developing hypertension in adulthood.\\nMajor contributors to high blood pressure are a family history of\\nthe disease, overweight, and dietary salt. Older individuals are athigher risk than younger people. Among older individuals, womenare more likely than men to develop high blood pressure. AfricanAmericans are more likely to develop high blood pressure, and atearlier ages, than Whites. But nearly all of us are at risk, especiallyas we grow older. Middle-aged Americans who don’t currently have high blood pressure have a 90-percent chance of eventuallydeveloping the disease.\\nHigh blood pressure is often called the silent killer because it \\nusually doesn’t cause symptoms. As a result, many people pay littleattention to their blood pressure until they become seriously ill.According to a national survey, two-thirds of people with high blood pressure do not have it under control. The good news is thatyou can take action to control or prevent high blood pressure, andthereby avoid many life-threatening disorders. A new blood pres-sure category, called prehypertension, has been created to alert peo-ple to their increased risk of developing high blood pressure so thatthey can take steps to prevent the disease.Your Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Everyone has to have some blood pressure,so that blood can get to all of the body’s organs. Usually, bloodpressure is expressed as two numbers, such as 120/80, and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The first number is the systolic blood pressure, the amount of force used when the heart beats. The second number, or diastolic blood pressure, is thepressure that exists in the arteries between heartbeats.\\nBecause blood pressure changes often, your health care provider\\nshould check it on several different days before deciding whether it istoo high. Blood pressure is considered “high” when it stays aboveprehypertensive levels over a period of time. (See accompanying box.)13Major Risk FactorsYour Blood Pressure:\\nCrunching the Numbers\\nYour blood pressure category is determined by the higher \\nnumber of either your systolic or your diastolic measurement.\\nFor example, if your systolic number is 115 but your diastolicnumber is 85, your category is prehypertension. \\nSystolic Diastolic\\nNormal blood pressure Less than  and Less than\\n120 mmHg 80 mmHg\\nPrehypertension 120–139      or 80–89 mmHg\\nmmHg\\nHigh blood pressure 140 mmHg or 90 mmHg\\nor higher or higher\\nBlood Pressure'),\n",

But many people don’t realize that the second category—prehypertension—also increases your risk of heartattack, stroke, and heart failure. To the extent possible, everyoneshould aim for normal blood pressure levels.\\nBe aware, too, that a high systolic blood pressure level (first number)\\nis dangerous. If your systolic blood pressure is 140 mmHg or high-er, you are more likely to develop cardiovascular and kidney diseaseseven if your diastolic blood pressure (second number) is in the normal range. After age 50, people are more likely to develop highsystolic blood pressure. High systolic blood pressure is high bloodpressure. If you have this condition, you will need to take steps tocontrol it. High blood pressure can be controlled in two ways:  bychanging your lifestyle and by taking medication.\\nChanging Your Lifestyle\\nIf your blood pressure is not too high, you may be able to control it entirely by losing weight if you are overweight, getting regularphysical activity, cutting down on alcohol, and changing your eatinghabits. A special eating plan called DASH can help you lower yourblood pressure. DASH stands for “Dietary Approaches to StopHypertension.”  The DASH eating plan emphasizes fruits, vegeta-bles, whole-grain foods, and low-fat or fat-free milk and milk products.It is rich in magnesium, potassium, and calcium, as well as proteinand fiber. It is low in saturated and total fat and cholesterol, andlimits red meat, sweets, and beverages with added sugars.\\nIf you follow the DASH eating plan and also consume less sodium,\\nyou are likely to reduce your blood pressure even more. Sodium is asubstance that affects blood pressure. It is the main ingredient insalt and is found in many processed foods, such as soups, conven-ience meals, some breads and cereals, and salted snacks.\\nFor more on the DASH eating plan and other changes you can make\\nto lower and prevent high blood pressure, see the “Taking Charge”section of this guidebook (pages 45–82.)Your Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Before you leave your doctor’s office, make sure you understand the amount of medicineyou are supposed to take each day, and the specific times of day you should take it.\\nHigh Blood Cholesterol\\nHigh blood cholesterol is another major risk factor for heart diseasethat you can do something about. The higher your blood choles-terol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack. To prevent these disorders, you should makea serious effort to keep your cholesterol at healthy levels. Cholesterol\\nlowering is i mportant for everyone—women and men; younger, \\nmiddle-aged, and older adults; and people with and without heartdisease.\\nCholesterol and Your Heart\\nThe body needs cholesterol to function normally. However, yourbody makes all the cholesterol it needs. Over a period of years,extra cholesterol and fat circulating in the blood build up in thewalls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This buildup,called plaque, makes the arteries narrower and narrower. As aresult, less blood gets to the heart. Blood carries oxygen to theheart; if enough oxygen-rich blood cannot reach your heart, youmay suffer chest pain. If the blood supply to a portion of the heartis completely cut off, the result is a heart attack.\\nCholesterol travels in the blood in packages called lipoproteins.\\nLDL carries most of the cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol pack-aged in LDL is often called bad cholesterol, because too high a levelof LDL in your blood can lead to cholesterol buildup and blockagein your arteries.\\nAnother type of cholesterol is HDL, also called good cholesterol.\\nThat’s because HDL helps remove cholesterol from the body, preventing it from building up in your arteries.17Major Risk Factors'),\n",

That’s why it isimportant to get your cholesterol levels checked regularly. Starting atage 20, everyone should have their cholesterol levels checked bymeans of a blood test called a lipoprotein profile. Be sure to ask forthe test results, so you will know whether you need to lower yourcholesterol. Ask your doctor how soon you should be retested.\\nTotal cholesterol is a measure of the cholesterol in all of your\\nlipoproteins, including the “bad” cholesterol in LDL and the “good”cholesterol in HDL.

Triglyceride levels that are borderline high(150–199 mg/dL) or high (200–499 mg/dL) are signals of anincreased risk for heart disease. To reduce blood triglyceride levels, it is important to control your weight, get more physicalactivity, and avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. You shouldalso eat a diet that is low in saturated fat, trans fat, and choles-\\nterol and that avoids high amounts of carbohydrates.Sometimes, medication is needed. \\nTriglycerides\\n1 Diabetes is not on the list because a person with diabetes is considered to already be at\\nhigh risk for a heart attack—at the same level of risk as someone who has heart disease.Also, even though overweight and physical inactivity are not on this list of risk factors,they are conditions that raise your risk for heart disease and need to be corrected.'),\n",

These are the most commonly prescribed drugs for\\npeople who need a cholesterol-lowering medicine. Of all avail-able medications, statins lower LDL cholesterol the most, usuallyby 20 to 60 percent. Side effects are usually mild, although liverand muscle problems occur rarely. If you experience muscleaches or weakness, contact your doctor promptly.  \\nBile acid sequestrants. These medications lower LDL cholesterol\\nby about 10 to 20 percent. Bile acid sequestrants are often prescribed along with a statin to further decrease LDL cholesterol levels. Side effects may include constipation, bloating, nausea, andgas. However, long-term use of these medicines is considered safe. \\nNiacin. Niacin, or nicotinic acid, lowers total cholesterol, LDL\\ncholesterol, and triglyceride levels, while also raising HDL cholesterol. Niacin is available without a prescription, but it isimportant to use it only under a doctor’s care because of possi-ble serious side effects. In some people, it may worsen pepticulcers or cause liver problems, gout, or high blood sugar. \\nFibrates.

The second step is to take your\\nwaist measurement. For women, a waist measurement of over 35inches increases the risk of heart disease as well as the risks of highblood pressure, diabetes, and other serious health conditions. Formen, a waist measurement of more than 40 inches increases theserisks. To measure your waist correctly, stand and place a tape meas-ure around your middle, just above your hipbones. Measure yourwaist just after you breathe out.\\nStep 3: Review your risk. The final step in determining your need to\\nlose weight is to find out your other risk factors for heart disease.It is important to know whether you have any of the following:high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol,high triglycerides, high blood glucose (blood sugar), a family historyof heart disease, physical inactivity, or smoking.

More\\nthan 65 percent of people who have diabetes die of some type ofcardiovascular disease. Diabetic women are at especially high riskfor dying of heart disease and stroke. Today, about 14 million peo-ple in the United States have diagnosed diabetes. In addition, nearly6 million people have this serious disease but don’t know it.\\nThe type of diabetes that most commonly develops in adulthood is\\ntype 2 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas makes insulin, butthe body cannot use it properly and gradually loses the ability toproduce it. Type 2 diabetes is a serious disease. In addition toincreasing the risk for heart disease, it is the #1 cause of kidney failure, blindness, and lower limb amputation in adults. Diabetescan also lead to nerve damage and difficulties with fighting infection.\\nWhile the risk of type 2 \\ndiabetes increases after age\\n45, the disease is on the \\nrise among both children\\nand adults.

Even if you have no symptoms of diabetes, if you are overweight and have any of the risk factors fortype 2 diabetes, ask your doctor about getting tested for it. You havediabetes if your fasting blood glucose level is 126 mg/dL or higher.\\nIf you have diabetes, controlling your blood glucose (blood sugar)\\nlevels will help to prevent complications. Because diabetes is sostrongly linked with heart disease, managing diabetes must includekeeping certain factors under control. (See “The ABCs of DiabetesControl.”) Recommended levels of blood pressure and blood choles-terol control are lower for people with diabetes than for most oth-ers. Not smoking, being physically active, and taking aspirin daily(if your doctor recommends it) also are important ways to preventheart disease if you have diabetes.\\nSome people do not yet have diabetes, but are at high risk for devel-\\noping the disease. More than 14 million Americans have a conditionknown as “prediabetes,” in which blood glucose levels are higherthan normal but not yet in the diabetic range. Prediabetes is definedas a fasting blood glucose level of 100–125 mg/dL. New researchshows that many people with prediabetes can prevent or delay thedevelopment of diabetes by making modest changes in diet and levelof physical activity. (See “Preventing Diabetes.”) \\nPeople who are prediabetic also have a 50 percent greater chance \\nof having a heart attack or stroke than those with normal blood glucose levels.

A secondstudy found that people who followed the DASH eating plan and cut\\ndown on sodium had the biggest reductions in blood pressure. (Salt,or sodium chloride, and other forms of sodium are found in manyprocessed foods. Often, more salt is added to food during cookingand at the table.) So, for a truly winning combination, follow theDASH eating plan and lower your sodium intake as much as possible.The study found that the less sodium people consumed, the moretheir blood pressure dropped. (See ”The DASH Eating Plan” onpages 51–52 and “Please Don’t Pass the Salt” on page 52.) \\nWhile the DASH eating plan is geared especially toward people with\\nhigh blood pressure or prehypertension, it is a healthy plan foreveryone.

Weight loss can helpcontrol diabetes, as well as reduce high blood pressure and highblood cholesterol. Reaching a healthy weight can also help you tosleep more soundly, experience less pain from arthritis, and havemore energy to take part in activities you enjoy.\\nRemember, if you need to lose weight, even a small weight loss will\\nhelp lower your risk for heart disease and other serious health condi-tions.

Successful,\\nlasting weight loss requires a change of lifestyle, not a brief effort to drop pounds quickly. Otherwise, you will probably regain theweight.

Weightcontrol is a question of balance. You take in calories from the foods you eat. You burn off calories during physical activity.Cutting down on calories, especially calories from fat, is key to losing weight.

Include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, andlow-fat or fat-free milk, as well as fish, lean meat, poultry, or drybeans. Choose foods that are low in fat and added sugars. Choosesensible portion sizes. (See “Portion Distortion” on page 68.) \\nWatch calories . To lose weight, most overweight people will need to\\ncut 500 to 1,000 calories per day from their current diet.\\nFor tips on choosing low-fat, low-calorie foods, see “The Substitution\\nSolution” on pages 66–67.\\nKeep milk on the menu . Don’t cut out milk products as you try to\\nreduce calories and fat. Milk and milk products are rich in calcium, a nutrient that helps prevent the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis.Instead, choose low-fat or fat-free milk and milk products, whichhave the same amount of calcium as whole-milk products. Make theswitch gradually. If you are used to drinking whole milk, first cutback to 2 percent, then move to 1 percent, and finally to fat-free milk.\\nKeep moving . Physical activity is key to successful, long-term\\nweight loss. It can help you burn calories, trim extra fat from yourwaist, and control your appetite. It can also tone your muscles andincrease aerobic fitness. To lose weight and to prevent furtherweight gain, gradually build up to at least 60 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of theweek. If you’ve lost weight, in order to keep it off, you’ll need to do even more physical activity—from 60–90 minutes of daily mod-erate-intensity physical activity. But you don’t need to run yourselfragged. A recent study showed that moderate physical activity, suchas brisk walking, helps people lose weight as effectively as more vigorous exercise. For more tips, see “Get Moving!” on page 72.\\nSteer clear of fast food . A single meal from a fast food restaurant\\nmay contain as many calories as you need for a whole day! A recentstudy showed that young adults who eat frequently at fast foodrestaurants gain more weight and are at higher risk for diabetes inmiddle age than those who avoid the fast food habit.

If you are very overweight, or if you are\\noverweight and have other weight-related risk factors or diseases,your doctor may advise you to take a medicine to help you take offpounds. You should use a weight-loss drug only after you have trieda low-calorie diet, more moderate-intensity physical activity, andother lifestyle changes for 6 months without successfully losingweight. Because weight-loss medicines have side effects, you shouldconsider all of the risks and benefits before trying one of them.These drugs should be used along with a low-calorie eating plan andregular physical activity, not as a substitute for these lifestyle changes.\\nGet support . Tell your family and friends about your weight-loss\\nplans and let them know how they can be most helpful to you.Some people also find it useful to join a structured weight-loss pro-gram. The most effective groups provide support and advice for per-manently changing eating and physical activity habits. (See “HowTo Choose a Weight-Loss Program” on page 70.)\\nLock in your losses . After reaching your weight-loss goal, switch\\nyour efforts to keeping the weight off by continuing to eat a nutri-tious, lower calorie diet and getting regular physical activity. Tomaintain your weight, you’ll need to become even more active thanbefore:  Aim for 60 to 90 minutes of physical activity per day.While this may seem like a tall order, remember that you can countthe activities that you’re already doing.

Before each activity session, allow a 5-minute period of\\nslow-to-moderate movement to give your body a chance to limber upand get ready for more exercise. At the end of the warmup period,gradually increase your pace. Toward the end of your activity, takeanother 5 minutes to cool down with a slower, less energetic pace.It’s best to wait until after your activity to do stretching exercises.\\nListen to your body . A certain amount of stiffness is normal at first.\\nBut if you hurt a joint or pull a muscle, stop the activity for severaldays to avoid more serious injury.

Write down all of the reasons you want to stop smoking.\\n■Sign on the dotted line . Write a brief contract that states your \\nintention to stop smoking, your quitting date, and some ways you plan to reward yourself for becoming an exsmoker. Have someone sign it with you.\\n■Lineup support . Ask the person who cosigns your contract—or\\nanother friend or relative—to give you special support in your efforts to quit. Plan to get in touch with your support person regularly to share your progress and to get encouragement. If possible, quit with a friend or family member.\\nBreaking the Habit\\n■Know yourself . To quit successfully, you need to know your \\npersonal smoking “triggers.” These are the situations and feelings that typically bring on the urge to light up. Some common triggers are drinking coffee, having an alcoholic drink, talking on the phone, watching someone else smoke, and experiencing stress. Make a list of your own personal triggers.Especially during the first weeks after quitting, try to avoid as many triggers as you can.\\n■Find new habits . Replace your “triggers” with new activities \\nthat you don’t associate with smoking. For example, if you’ve always had a cigarette with a cup of coffee, switch to tea for a while. If stress is a trigger for you, try a relaxation exercise such as deep breathing to calm yourself. (Take a slow, deep breath, count to five, and release it. Repeat 10 times.) \\n■Keep busy . Get involved in activities that require you to use your\\nhands, such as needlework, art projects, jigsaw puzzles, or fix-upprojects around your house or apartment. When you feel the urge to put something in your mouth, try some vegetable sticks, apple slices, or sugarless gum.

Thanks to sleep research studies done over the \\npast several decades, it is now known that sleep has distinct stages that cycle throughout the night in predictable patterns.  How well \\nrested you are and how well you function depend \\nnot just on your total sleep time but on how much \\nsleep you get each night and the timing of your sleep stages. \\nYour brain and body functions stay active through\\xad\\nout  sleep, and each stage of sleep is linked to a \\nspecific type of brain waves (distinctive \\npatterns of electrical activity in the brain). \\nSleep is divided into two basic types: \\nrapid eye movement (REM) sleep and \\nnon-REM sleep (with three different \\nstages).  (For more information, see \\n“Types of Sleep” on page 5.)  Typically,  \\nsleep begins with non-REM sleep.  In stage 1 non-REM sleep, you sleep lightly and can be awakened easily by noises or \\nother disturbances.  During this first stage of sleep, your eyes move slowly, your \\nmuscles relax, and your heart and breath\\xad\\ning rates begin to slow.   You then enter \\nstage 2 non-REM sleep, which is defined \\nby slower brain waves with occasional bursts of rapid waves.   You spend about \\nhalf the night in this stage. \\nWhen you progress into stage 3 non-\\nREM sleep, your brain waves become  \\neven slower, and the brain produces  \\nextremely slow waves\\xa0almost exclusively  \\n(called Delta waves).  \\n'),\n",

Deep sleep; difficult to awaken; large slow brain waves, heart and respiratory rates are slow and muscles are relaxed. Usually first occurs about 90\\xa0minutes after you fall asleep, and longer, deeper periods occur during the second half of the night; cycles along with the non-REM stages throughout the night. \\nEyes move rapidly \\nbehind closed eyelids. \\nBreathing, heart rate, \\nand blood pressure ar\\ne \\nirregular. \\nDr\\neaming occurs.  \\nArm and leg muscles \\nare temporarily paralyzed. \\nTypes of Sleep \\nDuring REM sleep, your eyes move rapidly in different directions, even \\nthough your eyelids stay closed. Your breathing also becomes more rapid, irregular, and shallow, and your heart rate and blood pressure increase.  Dreaming typically occurs during REM sleep.  During this type of sleep, your arm and leg muscles are temporarily paralyzed so that you cannot “act out” any dreams that you may be having. What Is Sleep? '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataset\\\\healthy_sleep.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='6 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n You typically first enter REM sleep about an hour to an hour and a \\nhalf after falling asleep. After that, the sleep stages repeat them\\xadselves continuously while you sleep. As you sleep, REM sleep time becomes longer, while time spent in stage 3 non-REM sleep becomes shorter.  By the time you wake up, nearly all your sleep time has been spent in stages 1 and 2 of non-REM sleep and in REM sleep. If REM sleep is severely disrupted during one night, REM sleep time is typically longer than normal in subsequent nights until you catch up.  Overall, almost one-half of your total sleep time is spent in stage 2 non-REM sleep and about one-fifth each in deep sleep (stage 3 of non-REM sleep) and REM sleep.  In contrast, infants spend half or more of their total sleep time in REM sleep.  Gradually, as they grow, the percentage of total sleep time they spend in REM contin\\xadues to decrease, until it reaches the one-fifth level typical of later childhood and adulthood. \\nWhy people dream and why REM sleep is so important are not well \\nunderstood.  It is known that REM sleep stimulates the brain regions you use to learn and make memories. Animal studies suggest that dreams may reflect the brain’s sorting and selectively storing new information acquired during wake time. While this information is processed, the brain might revisit scenes from the day and mix them randomly.  Dreams are generally recalled when we wake briefly or are awakened by an alarm clock or some other noise in the environment.  Studies show, however, that other stages of sleep besides REM also are needed to form the pathways in the brain that enable us to learn and remember. \\n'),\n",

This need appears to be due, in part, to two sub\\xadstances your body produces.  One substance, called adenosine, builds up in your blood while you’re awake. Then, while you sleep, your body breaks down the adenosine.  Levels of this substance in your body may help trigger sleep when needed. \\nA buildup of adenosine and many other complex factors might \\nexplain why, after several nights of less than optimal amounts of sleep, you build up a sleep debt. This may cause you to sleep longer than normal or at unplanned times during the day.  Because of your body’s internal processes, you can’t adapt to getting less sleep than your body needs.  Eventually, a lack of sleep catches up with you. \\nThe other substance that helps make you sleep is a hormone called \\nmelatonin. This hormone makes you naturally feel sleepy at night. It is part of your internal “biological clock,” which controls when you feel sleepy and your sleep patterns. Your biological clock is a small bundle of cells in your brain that works throughout the day and night.  Internal and external environmental cues, such as light signals received through your eyes, control these cells. Your biologi\\xadcal clock triggers your body to produce melatonin, which helps prepare your brain and body for sleep. As melatonin is released, you’ll feel increasingly drowsy.  Because of your biological clock, you naturally feel the most tired between midnight and 7 a.m. You also may feel mildly sleepy in the afternoon between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. when another increase in melatonin occurs in your body. \\nYour biological clock makes you the most alert during daylight \\nhours and the least alert during the early morning hours.  Conse\\xadquently, most people do their best work during the day.  Our 24/7 society, however, demands that some people work at night.  Nearly one-quarter of all workers work shifts that are not during the daytime, and more than two-thirds of these workers have problem sleepiness and/or difficulty sleeping.

Night shift workers are also more likely to have physical problems, such as heart disease, digestive troubles, and infertility, as well as emotional problems.   All of these problems may \\nbe related, at least in part, to the workers’ chronic sleepiness, possi\\xadbly because their biological clocks are not in tune with their work schedules.  See “Working the Night Shift” on page 9 for some helpful tips if you work a night shift. \\nOther factors also can influence your need for sleep, including your \\nimmune system’s production of hormones called cytokines.  Cyto\\xadkines are made to help the immune system fight certain infections or chronic inflammation and may prompt you to sleep more than usual.   The extra sleep may help you conserve the resources needed \\nto fight the infection.  Recent studies confirm that being well rested improves the body’s responses to infection. \\nPeople are creatures of \\nhabit, and one of the hardest habits to break is the natural wake and sleep cycle.

The light cues outside and the clocks in your new location may tell you it is 8\\xa0a.m. and you should be active, but your body is telling you it is more like 4 a.m. and you should sleep.

If you are going to be away for just a few days, it may be better to stick to your original sleep and wake times as much as possible, rather than adjusting your biological clock too many times in rapid succession. \\nEastward travel generally causes more severe jet lag than \\nwestward travel because traveling east requires you to shorten the day, and your biological clock is better able to adjust to a longer day than a shorter day.  Fortunately for globetrotters, a few preventive measures and adjustments seem to help some people relieve jet lag, particularly when they are going to spend more than a few days at their destination: \\nl\\t  \\nl\\t  Adjust your biological clock. During the 2–3 days prior to a \\nlong trip, get adequate sleep. You can make minor changes to your sleep schedule. For example, if you are traveling west, delay your bed time and wake time progr\\nessively by \\n20- to 30-minute intervals. If you are traveling east, advance your wake time by 10 to 15\\xa0minutes a day for a few days and try to advance your bed time. Decreasing light exposure at bedtime and increasing light exposure at wake time can help you make these adjustments. When you arrive at your destination, spend a lot of time outdoors so your body gets the light cues it needs to adjust to the new time zone. Take a couple of short 10–15 minute catnaps if you feel tired, but do not take long naps during the day. \\nAvoid alcohol and caffeine.  Although it may be tempting \\nto drink alcohol to relieve the stress of travel and make it \\neasier to fall asleep, you’re more likely to sleep lighter and wake up in the middle of the night when the ef\\nfects of the \\nalcohol wear off.  Caffeine can help keep you awake longer, but caffeine also can make it harder for you to fall asleep if its effects haven’t worn off by the time you are ready to go to bed. Therefore, it’s best to use caffeine only during the morning and not during the afternoon. '),\n",

Melatonin builds up in your body during the early evening and into the first 2 hours of your sleep period, and then its r\\nelease stops in the middle of \\nthe night. \\nMelatonin is available as an over-the-counter supplement.  \\nBecause melatonin is considered safe when used over a period of days or weeks and seems to help people feel sleepy, it has been suggested as a treatment for jet lag.  But melatonin’s effectiveness is controversial, and its safety when used over a prolonged period is unclear. Some studies find that taking melatonin supplements before bedtime for several days after arrival in a new time zone can make it easier to fall asleep at the proper time.  Other studies find that melatonin does not help relieve jet lag. \\nWhat Makes You Sleep?\\nJet Lag\\n '),\n",

Recent studies reveal that people can learn a task better if they are well rested. They also can better remember what they learned if they get a good night’s sleep after learning the task than if they are sleep deprived.  Study volunteers had to sleep at least 6 hours to show improvement in learning. Additionally, the amount of improvement was directly related to how much time they slept—for example, volunteers who slept 8 hours outperformed those who slept only 6 or 7 hours.  Other studies suggest that it’s important to get enough rest the night before a mentally challenging task, rather than only sleeping for a short period or waiting to sleep until after the task is complete. \\nMany well-known artists and scientists claim to have had creative \\ninsights while they slept.  Mary Shelley, for example, said the idea for her novel Frankenstein came to her in a dream. Although it has not been shown that dreaming is the driving force behind innova\\xadtion, one study suggests that sleep is needed for creative problem-solving.  In that study, volunteers were asked to perform a memory task and then were tested on it 8\\xa0hours later. Those who were allowed to sleep for 8 hours immediately after trying the task and before being tested were much more likely to find a creative way of simplifying the task and improving their performance, compared with those who were awake the entire 8 hours before being tested. \\nExactly what happens during sleep to improve our learning, memo\\xad\\nry, and insight isn’t known.  Experts suspect, however, that while '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataset\\\\healthy_sleep.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='13 \\n  \\n  \\n  people sleep, they form or strengthen the pathways of brain cells \\nneeded to perform these tasks. This process may explain why sleep is needed for proper brain development in infants. \\nNot only is a good night’s sleep required to form new learning and \\nmemory pathways in the brain, but also sleep is necessary for those pathways to work well.  Several studies show that lack of sleep causes thinking processes to slow down.  Lack of sleep also makes it harder to focus and pay attention.  Lack of sleep can make you more easily confused.  Studies also find that a lack of sleep leads to faulty decisionmaking and more risk taking. A lack of sleep slows down your reaction time, which is particularly important to driving and other tasks that require quick response. When people who lack sleep are tested on a driving simulator, they perform just as poorly as people who are drunk.  (See “Crash in Bed, Not on the Road” on page 16.) The bottom line is: Not getting a good night’s sleep can be dangerous! \\nEven if you don’t have a mentally or physically challenging day \\nahead of you, you should still get enough sleep to put yourself in a good mood.  Most people report being irritable, if not downright unhappy, when they lack sleep.  People who chronically suffer from a lack of sleep, either because they do not spend enough time in bed or because they have an untreated sleep disorder, are at greater risk of developing depression.  One group of people who usually don’t get enough sleep is mothers of newborns.  Some experts think \\ndepression after childbirth (postpar\\xad\\ntum blues) is caused, in part, by a \\nlack of sleep. \\nYour Heart \\nSleep gives your heart and \\nvascular system a much-needed \\nrest.

These changes throughout the night in blood pressure and heart and breathing rates seem to promote cardiovascular health. \\nIf you don’t get enough sleep, the nightly dip in blood pressure that \\nappears to be important for good cardiovascular health may not occur.  Failure to experience the normal dip in blood pressure during sleep can be related to insufficient sleep time, an untreated sleep disorder (for example, sleep apnea), or other factors.  Some sleep-related abnormalities may be markers of heart disease and increased risk of stroke. \\nA lack of sleep also puts your body under stress and may trigger the \\nrelease of more adrenaline, cortisol, and other stress hormones during the day. These hormones keep your blood pressure from dipping during sleep, which increases your risk for heart disease. Lack of sleep also may trigger your body to produce more of certain proteins thought to play a role in heart disease.  For example, some studies find that people who repeatedly don’t get enough sleep have higher than normal blood levels of C-reactive protein, a sign of inflammation.  High levels of this protein may indicate an increased risk for a condition called atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. \\nYour Hormones \\nWhen you were young, your mother may have told you that you need to get enough sleep to grow strong and tall.  She may have been right! Deep sleep (stage 3 non-REM sleep) triggers more release of growth hormone, which contributes to growth in children and boosts muscle mass and the repair of cells and tissues in children and adults.  Sleep’s effect on the release of sex\\xa0hormones also contributes to puberty and fertility.  Consequently, women who work at night and tend to lack sleep may be at increased risk of miscarriage. \\nYour mother also probably was right if she told you that getting a \\ngood night’s sleep on a regular basis would help keep you from getting sick and help you get better if you do get sick.  During sleep, your body creates more cytokines—cellular hormones that help the immune system fight various infections.  Lack of sleep can reduce your body’s ability to fight off common infections.  Research also reveals that a lack of sleep can reduce the body’s response to the flu '),\n",

For example, sleep-deprived volunteers given the flu \\nvaccine produced less than half as many flu antibodies as those who were well rested and given the same vaccine. \\nAlthough lack of exercise and\\xa0other factors also contribute, the \\ncurrent epidemic of diabetes and obesity seems to be related, at least in part, to\\xa0chronically short or disrupted sleep or not sleeping during the night.  Evidence is growing that sleep is a powerful regulator of appetite, energy use, and weight control.  During sleep, the body’s production of the appetite suppressor leptin increases, and the appetite stimulant grehlin decreases.  Studies find that the less people sleep, the more likely they are to be overweight or obese and prefer eating foods that are higher in calories and carbohydrates.  People who report an average total sleep time of 5 hours a night, for example, are much more likely to become obese, compared with people who sleep 7–8\\xa0hours a night. \\nA number of hormones released during sleep also control the body’s \\nuse of energy. A distinct rise and fall of blood sugar levels during sleep appears to be linked to sleep stages.  Not sleeping at the right time, not getting enough sleep overall, or not enough of each stage of sleep disrupts this pattern.  One study found that, when healthy young men slept only 4 hours a night for 6 nights in a row, their insulin and blood sugar levels matched those seen in people who were developing diabetes.   Another \\nstudy found that women who slept less than 7 hours a night were more likely to develop diabetes over time than those who slept between  7 and 8 hours a night. \\nWhat Does Sleep Do for You?

But \\ndriving while sleepy can be just as dangerous.  Indeed, crashes due to sleepy drivers are as deadly as those due to drivers impaired by alcohol.  And you don’t have to be asleep at the wheel to put yourself and others in danger.  Both alcohol and a lack of sleep limit your ability to react quickly to a suddenly braking car, a sharp curve in the road, or other situations that require rapid responses.  Just a few seconds’ delay in reaction time can be a life-or-death matter when driving. When people who lack sleep are tested on a driving simulator, they perform as badly as or worse than those who are drunk.  The combination of alcohol and lack of sleep can be especially dangerous.  There is increasing evidence that sleep deprivation and inexperience behind the wheel, both particularly common in adolescents, is a lethal combination. \\nOf course, driving is also hazardous if you fall asleep at the \\nwheel, which happens surprisingly often. One-quarter of the drivers surveyed in New York State reported they had fallen asleep at the wheel at some time. Often, people briefly nod off at the wheel without being aware of it—they just can’t recall what happened over the previous few seconds or longer.  And people who lack sleep are more apt to take risks and make poor judgments, which also can boost their chances of getting in a car crash. \\nOpening a window or turning up the radio won’t help you \\nstay awake while driving. The bottom line is that there is no substitute for sleep. Be aware of these warning signs that you are too sleepy to drive safely:  trouble keeping your eyes open or focused, continual yawning, or being unable to recall driving the past few miles. Remember, if you are short on sleep, stay out of the driver’s\\xa0seat! '),\n",

But how much sleep do humans need? To help answer that question, scientists look at how much people sleep when unrestricted, the average amount of sleep among various age groups, and the amount of sleep that studies\\xa0reveal is necessary to function at your best. \\nWhen healthy adults are given unlimited opportunity to sleep, they \\nsleep on average between 8 and 8.5 hours a night.  But sleep needs vary from person to person.  Some people appear to\\xa0need only about 7 hours to avoid problem sleepiness, whereas others need 9 or more hours of sleep.  Sleep needs also change throughout the life cycle. Newborns sleep between 16 and 18\\xa0hours a day, and children in preschool sleep between 11\\xa0and 12 hours a day.  School-aged children and adolescents need at least 10 hours of sleep each night. \\nThe hormonal influences of puberty tend to shift adolescents’ biologi\\xad\\ncal clocks. As a result, teenagers (who need between 9\\xa0and 10 hours of sleep a night) are more likely to go to bed later than younger children and adults, and they tend to want to sleep later in the morning. This delayed sleep–wake rhythm conflicts with the early-morning start times of many high schools and helps explain why most teenagers get an average of\\xa0only 7–7.5 hours of sleep a night. \\nAs people get older, the pattern of sleep also changes—especially the \\namount of time spent in deep sleep. This explains why children can sleep through loud noises and why they might\\xa0not wake up when moved.

No evidence shows that any major \\norgan (including the brain) or regulatory system in the body shuts down during sleep. Some physiological processes actually become more active while you sleep.  For example, secretion of certain hormones is boosted, and activity of the pathways in the brain linked to learning and memory increases. \\nMyth 2: Getting just 1 hour less sleep per night than needed \\nwill not have any effect on your daytime functioning.  This \\nlack of sleep may not make you noticeably sleepy during the day.  But even slightly less sleep can affect your ability to think properly and respond quickly, and it can impair your cardiovascular health and energy balance as well as your body’s ability to fight infections, particularly if lack of sleep continues. If you consistently do not get enough sleep, a sleep debt builds up that you can never repay.  This sleep debt affects your health and quality of life and makes you feel tired during the day. \\nMyth 3: Your body adjusts quickly to different sleep \\nschedules.  Your biological clock makes you most alert during the daytime and least alert at night. Thus, even if you work the night shift, you will naturally feel sleepy when nighttime comes. Most people can reset their biological clock, but only by appropriately timed cues—and even then, by 1–2 hours per day at best. Consequently, it can take more than a week to adjust to a substantial change in your sleep–wake cycle—for example, when traveling across several time zones or switching from working the day shift to the night shift. \\nMyth 4: People need less sleep as they get older. Older \\npeople don’t need less sleep, but they may get less sleep or find \\ntheir sleep less refreshing.  That’s because as people age, the quality of their sleep changes. Older people are also more likely to have insomnia or other medical conditions that disrupt their sleep. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataset\\\\healthy_sleep.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='23 \\nMyth 5: Extra sleep for one night can cure you of problems \\nwith excessive daytime fatigue.  Not only is the quantity of \\nsleep important, but also the quality of sleep. Some people sleep 8 or 9 hours a night but don’t feel well rested when they wake up because the quality of their sleep is poor.  A number of sleep disorders and other medical conditions affect the quality of sleep. Sleeping more won’t lessen the daytime sleepiness these disorders or conditions cause.  However, many of these disorders or conditions can be treated effectively with changes in behavior or with medical therapies. Additionally, one night of increased sleep may not correct multiple nights of inadequate sleep. \\nMyth 6: You can make up for lost sleep during the week \\nby sleeping more on the weekends.  Although this sleeping \\npattern will help you feel more rested, it will not completely make up for the lack of sleep or correct your sleep debt.  This pattern also will not necessarily make up for impaired performance during the week or the physical problems that can result from not sleeping enough.  Furthermore, sleeping later on the weekends can affect your biological clock, making it much harder to go to sleep at the right time on Sunday nights and get up early on Monday mornings. \\nMyth 7: Naps are a waste of time.  Although naps are no \\nsubstitute for a good night’s sleep, they can be restorative and help counter some of the effects of not getting enough sleep at night. Naps can actually help you learn how to do certain tasks quicker\\n.  But avoid \\ntaking naps later than 3\\xa0p.m., particularly if you have trouble falling asleep at night, as late naps can make it harder for you to fall asleep when you go to bed. Also, limit your naps to no longer than 20\\xa0minutes, because longer naps will make it harder to wake up and \\nHow Much Sleep Is Enough? '),\n",

Snoring during \\nsleep is common, particularly as a person gets older.  Evidence \\nis growing that snoring on a regular basis can make you sleepy during the day and increase your risk for diabetes and heart disease. In addition, some studies link frequent snoring to problem behavior and poorer school achievement in children.  Loud, frequent snoring also can be a sign of sleep apnea, a serious sleep disorder that should be evaluated and treated.  (See “Is Snoring a Problem?” on page 30.) \\nMyth 9: Children who don’t get enough sleep at night will \\nshow signs of sleepiness during the day.  Unlike adults, \\nchildren who don’t get enough sleep at night typically become hyperactive, irritable, and inattentive during the day.  They also have increased risk of injury and more behavior problems, and their growth rate may be impaired.  Sleep debt appears to be quite common during childhood and may be misdiagnosed as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. \\nMyth 10: The main cause of insomnia is worry.  Although \\nworry or stress can cause a short bout of insomnia, a persistent \\ninability to fall asleep or stay asleep at night can be caused by a number of other factors. Certain medications and sleep disorders can keep you up at night.  Other common causes of insomnia are depression, anxiety disorders, and asthma, arthritis, or other medical conditions with symptoms that tend to be troublesome at night.  Some people who have chronic insomnia also appear to be more “revved up” than normal, so it is harder \\nfor them to fall asleep. \\nSleep Myths\\n '),\n",

These factors range \\nfrom well-known stimulants, such as coffee, to certain pain relievers, decongestants, and other culprits.  Many people depend on the caffeine in coffee, cola, or tea to wake them up in the morning or to keep them awake.  Caffeine is thought to block the cell receptors that adenosine (a substance in the brain) uses to trigger its sleep-inducing signals.  In this way, caffeine fools the body into thinking it isn’t tired.  It can take as long as 6–8 hours for the effects of caffeine to wear off completely. Thus, drinking a cup of coffee in the late afternoon may prevent your falling asleep at night. \\nNicotine is another stimulant that can keep you awake.  Nicotine \\nalso leads to lighter than normal sleep, and heavy smokers tend to wake up too early because of nicotine withdrawal. Although alcohol is a sedative that makes it easier to fall asleep, it prevents deep sleep and REM sleep, allowing only the lighter stages of sleep. People who drink alcohol also tend to wake up in the middle of the night when the effects of an alcoholic “nightcap” wear off. \\nCertain commonly used prescrip\\xad\\ntion and over-the-counter medi\\xadcines contain ingredients that can keep you awake. These ingredients include decongestants and steroids. Many medicines taken to relieve headaches contain caffeine.  Heart and blood pressure medications known as beta blockers can make it difficult to fall asleep and cause more awakenings during the night.

Other chronic painful or uncomfortable conditions— \\nsuch as arthritis, congestive heart failure, and sickle cell anemia— can disrupt sleep, too. \\nA number of psychological disorders—including schizophrenia, \\nbipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders—are well known for disrupt\\xading sleep.  Depression often leads to insomnia, and insomnia can cause depression.  Some of these psychological disorders are more likely to disrupt REM sleep.  Psychological stress also takes its toll on sleep, making it more difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep. People who feel stressed also tend to spend less time in deep sleep and REM sleep.  Many people report having difficulties sleeping if, for example, they have recently lost a loved one, are going through a divorce, or are under stress at work. \\nMenstrual cycle hormones can affect how well women sleep.  Pro\\xad\\ngesterone is known to induce sleep and circulates in greater concen\\xadtrations in the second half of the menstrual cycle.  For this reason, women may sleep better during this phase of their menstrual cycle. On the other hand, many women report trouble sleeping the night before their menstrual flow starts. This sleep disruption may be related to the abrupt drop in progesterone levels that occurs just before menstruation. Women in their late forties and early fifties, however, report more difficulties sleeping (insomnia) than younger women. These difficulties may be linked to menopause, when they have lower concentrations of progesterone.  Hot flashes in women of this age also may cause sleep disruption and difficulties. \\nCertain lifestyle factors also may deprive a person \\nof needed sleep.  Large meals or vigorous exercise just before bedtime can make it harder to fall asleep.   While vigorous exercise \\nin the evening may delay sleep onset for various reasons, exercise in the daytime is associated with improved nighttime sleep. \\nIf you aren’t getting enough sleep \\nor aren’\\nt falling asleep early \\nenough, you may be overscheduling activi\\xadties that can pre\\xadvent you from getting the \\n'),\n",

Most people \\nreport that it’s easier to fall asleep if they have time to wind down into a less active state before sleeping.  Relaxing in a hot bath or having a hot, caffeine-free beverage before bedtime may help.

How\\xadever, snoring is no laughing matter.  Frequent, loud snoring is often a sign of sleep apnea and may increase your risk of developing cardio\\xadvascular disease and diabetes.  Snoring also may lead to daytime sleepiness and impaired performance. \\nSnoring is caused by a narrowing or partial blockage of the airways \\nat the back of your mouth, throat, or nose. This obstruction results in increased air turbulence when breathing in, causing the soft tissues in your upper airways to vibrate. The end result is a noisy snore that can disrupt the sleep of your bed partner. This narrowing of the airways is typically caused by the soft palate, tongue, and throat relaxing while you sleep, but allergies or sinus problems also can contribute to a narrowing of the airways, as can being over\\xadweight and having extra soft tissue around your upper airways. \\nThe larger the tissues in your soft palate (the roof of your mouth in \\nthe back of your throat), the more likely you are to snore while sleeping. Alcohol or sedatives taken shortly before sleep also promote snoring. These drugs cause greater relaxation of the tissues Your Guide to Healthy Sleep in your throat and mouth.  Surveys reveal that about one-half of all adults snore, and 50 percent of these adults do so loudly and frequently.  African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics are more likely to snore loudly and frequent\\xadly compared with Caucasians, and snoring problems increase with age. \\nNot everyone who snores has sleep \\napnea, but people who have sleep apnea typically do snore loudly and frequently.

(See “Sleep Apnea” on page 38.)  Even if you don’t experience these breathing pauses, snoring can still be a problem for you as well as for your bed partner.  Snoring adds extra effort to your breathing, which can reduce the quality of your sleep and lead to many of the same health consequences as sleep apnea. \\nOne study found that older adults who did not have sleep apnea, \\nbut who snored 6–7 nights a week, were more than twice as likely to report being extremely sleepy during the day than those who never snored. The more people snored, the more daytime fatigue they reported. That sleepiness may help explain why snorers are more likely to be in car crashes than people who don’t snore.  Loud snoring also can disrupt the sleep of bed partners and strain marital relations, especially if snoring causes the spouses to sleep in separate bedrooms. \\nIn addition, snoring increases the risk of developing diabetes and \\nheart disease.  One study found that women who snored regularly were twice as likely as those who did not snore to develop diabetes, even if they were not overweight (another risk factor for diabetes). Other studies suggest that regular snoring may raise the lifetime risk of developing high blood pressure, heart failure, and stroke. \\nAbout one-third of all pregnant women begin snoring for the first \\ntime during their second trimester.  If you are snoring while preg\\xadnant, let your doctor know.  Snoring in pregnancy can be associated with high blood pressure and can have a negative effect on your baby’s growth and development. Your doctor will keep a close eye on your blood pressure throughout your pregnancy and can let you know if any additional evaluations for the snoring might be useful. In most cases, the snoring and\\xa0any related high blood pressure will go away shortly after delivery. \\nSnoring also can be a problem in children. As many as 10–15\\xa0per\\xad\\ncent of young children, who typically have enlarged adenoids and tonsils (both tissues in the throat), snore on a regular basis.  Several studies show that children who snore (with or without sleep apnea) are more likely than those who do not snore to score lower on tests that measure intelligence, memory, and attention span. These children also have more problematic behavior, including hyperactiv\\xadity. The end result is that children who snore don’t perform in Is Snoring a Problem? '),\n",

Strikingly, snoring was \\nlinked to a greater drop in IQ than that seen in children who had elevated levels of lead in their blood. Although the behavior of children improves after they stop snoring, studies suggest they may continue to get poorer grades in school, perhaps because of lasting effects on the brain linked to the snoring. You should have your child evaluated by your doctor if the child snores loudly and frequently—three to four times a week—especially if you note brief pauses in breathing while asleep and if there are signs of hyperactiv\\xadity or daytime sleepiness, inadequate school achievement, or slower than expected development. \\nSurgery to remove the adenoids and tonsils of children often can \\ncure their snoring and any associated sleep apnea.  Such surgery has been linked to a reduction in hyperactivity and improved ability to pay attention, even in children who showed no signs of sleep apnea before surgery. \\nSnoring in older children and adults may be relieved by less invasive \\nmeasures, however. These measures include losing weight, refraining from use of tobacco, sleeping on the side rather than on the back, or elevating the head while sleeping. Treating chronic congestion and refraining from alcohol or sedatives before sleeping also may de\\xadcrease snoring.  In some adults, snoring can be relieved by dental appliances that reposition the soft tissues in the mouth. Although numerous over-the-counter nasal strips and sprays claim to relieve snoring, no scientific evidence supports those claims. '),\n",

Life is filled with events that occasionally cause insomnia for a short time.  Such temporary insomnia is common and is often brought on by situations such as stress at work, family pressures, or a traumatic event. A National Sleep Foundation poll of adults in the United States found that close to\\xa0half of the respondents reported temporary insomnia in the nights immediately after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. \\nChronic insomnia is defined as having symptoms at least 3\\xa0nights\\xa0\\nper week for more than 1\\xa0month.  Most cases of chronic\\xa0insomnia are secondary, which means they are due to another disorder or medications.  Primary chronic insomnia is a\\xa0distinct sleep disorder; its cause is not yet well understood. About 30–40\\xa0percent of adults say they have some symptoms of\\xa0insomnia within any given year, and about 10–15 percent of adults say they have chronic insomnia. Chronic insomnia becomes more common with age, and women are more likely than men to report having insomnia. \\nInsomnia often causes problems during the day, such as extreme \\nsleepiness, fatigue, a lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, and irritability. Thus, untreated insomnia can impair quality of life as much as, or more than, other chronic medical problems. \\nChronic insomnia is often caused by one or more of the following: \\nA disease or mood disorder. The most common causes of \\ninsomnia are depression and/or anxiety disorders.  Neuro\\xadlogical disorders, such as Alzheimer’\\ns or Parkinson’s disease, \\nalso can have insomnia as a symptom.  Chronic insomnia can result from thyroid dysfunction, arthritis, asthma, or other medical conditions in which symptoms become more trouble\\xadsome at night, making it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep. \\nVarious prescribed and over-the-counter medications that can \\ndisrupt sleep, such as decongestants, certain pain relievers, and steroids.

People who have primary chronic insomnia may have heightened levels of certain hormones, higher body tempera\\xadtures, faster heart rates, and a different pattern of brain waves while they sleep. \\nDoctors diagnose insomnia based mainly on sleep history, often by \\nreviewing a sleep diary. An overnight sleep recording may be required if another sleep disorder is suspected.  Doctors also will try to diagnose and treat any other underlying medical or psychological problems as well as identify behaviors that might be causing the insomnia. \\nOften, people who have insomnia enter into a vicious cycle—because \\nthey’ve had trouble sleeping on previous nights, they become anxious at the slightest sign that they may not be falling asleep right away. That anxiety can make it more difficult for them to fall asleep. The more time they spend in bed not sleeping, and watching the clock, the more their anxiety—and sleeplessness—increases. \\nTo break that cycle of anxiety and negative conditioning, experts \\nrecommend going to bed only when you’re sleepy.  If you can’t fall asleep (or fall back to sleep) within 20 minutes, get out of bed, go into another room, and do a relaxing activity (such as reading) until you feel sleepy again. Then return to bed.  Studies have shown that this reconditioning therapy is an effective way to treat insomnia. \\nRelaxation therapy is another strategy that works for some people \\nwho have insomnia.  Relaxation therapy may include meditation and other mental relaxation techniques.  It also may include physical relaxation techniques, such as progressively tensing and then relax\\xading each of the muscle groups in your body before sleep. Another method is to focus on breathing deeply.  Relaxation therapy can help your body and mind slow down so that you can fall asleep more easily at bedtime. '),\n",

Calculate your average sleep time over the course of a week, and then limit your nightly sleep time to that average.  Gradu\\xadally add more sleep time each night until you achieve a more normal night’s sleep. You\\xa0should avoid daytime naps longer than 15–20\\xa0min\\xadutes during sleep restriction therapy.  Napping can make it harder to fall asleep at night, which may prolong insomnia.  In addition, during sleep restriction therapy, avoid driving a car or operating dangerous machinery until you are getting enough sleep at night. \\nAll of these behavioral changes are part of a treatment called \\ncognitive behavioral therapy.  Cognitive behavioral therapy also can be used to replace negative thoughts about sleep, such as “I’ll never fall asleep without sleeping pills,” with more realistic positive thinking.  Cognitive behavioral therapy is effective in most people who have chronic insomnia. \\nSome people who have chronic insomnia that is not corrected by \\nbehavioral therapy or treatment of\\xa0an underlying condition may\\xa0need a prescription medication. You should talk to a doctor before trying to treat insomnia with alcohol, over-the-counter or \\nprescribed short-acting sedatives, or sedating \\nantihistamines that induce drowsiness. \\nThe benefits of these treatments are \\nlimited, and they have risks.  Some \\nmay help you fall asleep but leave you feeling unrefreshed in the morning.   \\nOthers have longer lasting effects and \\nleave you feeling still tired and groggy \\nin the morning.  Some also may lose \\ntheir effectiveness over time.   \\nDoctors may prescribe sedating \\nantidepressants for insomnia,  \\nbut the effectiveness of these  \\nmedicines in people who do \\nnot have depression is not \\nknown, and there are \\nsignificant side effects. \\nCommon Sleep Disorders '),\n",

These remedies are available over the counter.  Little evidence exists that melatonin can help relieve insomnia.  Studies with valerian also have been inconclusive, and the actual dose and purity of various supplements, extracts, or teas\\xa0that contain valerian may vary from product to product.  In addition, because melatonin, valerian, and other natural remedies are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, their safety is not monitored. \\nSleep Apnea \\nIn people who have sleep apnea (also referred to as sleep-disordered breathing), breathing briefly stops or becomes very shallow during sleep. This change is caused by intermittent blocking of the upper airway, usually when the soft tissue in the rear of the throat collapses and partially or completely closes the airway.  Each pause in breathing typically lasts 10–120 seconds and may occur 20–30 times or more each sleeping hour. \\nIf you have sleep apnea, not enough air can flow into your lungs \\nthrough your mouth and nose during sleep, even though breathing efforts continue. When this happens, the amount of oxygen in your blood decreases. Your brain responds by awakening you enough to tighten the upper airway muscles and\\xa0open your windpipe.  Normal breaths then start again, often with a loud snort or choking sound. Although people who have sleep apnea typically snore loudly and frequently, not\\xa0everyone who snores has sleep apnea.  (See “Is Snoring a Problem?” on page 30.) \\nBecause people who have sleep apnea frequently go from deeper \\nsleep to lighter sleep during the night, they rarely spend enough time in deep, restorative stages of sleep. They are therefore often exces\\xadsively sleepy during the day.  Such sleepiness is thought to lead to mood and behavior problems, including depression, and it more than triples the risk of being in a traffic or work-related accident. \\nThe many brief drops in blood-oxygen levels that occur during the \\nnight can result in morning headaches and trouble concentrating, thinking clearly, learning, and remembering. Additionally, the intermittent oxygen drops and reduced sleep quality together trigger the release of stress hormones. These hormones raise your blood pressure and heart rate and boost the risk of heart attack, stroke, irregular heartbeats, and congestive heart failure.  In addition, '),\n",

Changes in daily activities or habits may help reduce your symptoms: \\nSleep on your side instead of on your bac\\n k. Sleeping on your \\nside will help reduce the amount of upper airway collapse during sleep. \\nAvoid alcohol, smoking, sleeping pills, herbal supplements, \\nand any other medications that make you sleepy.  They make \\nit harder for your airways to stay open while you sleep,\\n and \\nsedatives can make the breathing pauses longer and more severe. Tobacco smoke irritates the airways and can help trigger the intermittent collapse of the upper airway. \\nLose weight if you are overweight.  Even a little weight loss \\ncan sometimes improve symptoms. \\nThese changes may be all that are needed to treat mild sleep apnea. \\nHowever, if you have moderate or severe sleep apnea, you will need additional, more direct treatment approaches. \\nContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective \\ntreatment for sleep apnea in adults. A CP\\nAP machine uses mild air \\npressure to keep your airways open while you sleep. The machine delivers air to your airways through a specially designed nasal mask. The mask does not breathe for you; the flow of air creates increased pressure to keep the airways in your nose and mouth more open while you sleep. The air pressure is adjusted so that it is just enough to stop your airways from briefly becoming too small during sleep. The pressure is constant and continuous.  Sleep apnea will return if CPAP is stopped or if it is used incorrectly. \\nPeople who have severe sleep apnea symptoms generally feel much \\nbetter once they begin treatment with CPAP.  CPAP treatment can cause side effects in some people.  Possible side effects include dry or stuffy nose, irritation of the skin on the face, bloating of the stom\\xadach, sore eyes, or headaches.  If you have trouble with CPAP side effects, work with your sleep specialist and support staff. Together, you can do things to reduce or eliminate these problems. \\nCurrently, no medications cure sleep apnea.  However, some \\nprescription medications may help relieve the excessive sleepiness that sometimes persists even with CPAP treatment of sleep apnea. '),\n",

If you have mild sleep apnea or do not have sleep apnea but snore very loudly, your doctor or dentist also may recommend this.   A custom-fitted plastic mouth\\xad\\npiece will be made by a dentist or an orthodontist (a specialist in correcting teeth or jaw problems).   The mouthpiece will adjust your \\nlower jaw and tongue to help keep the airway in your throat more open while you are sleeping.

Following up with the dentist or orthodontist is important to correct any side effects and to be sure that your mouthpiece continues to fit properly.   \\nIt is also important to have a followup sleep study to see whether your sleep apnea has improved. \\nSome people who have sleep apnea may benefit from surgery; this \\ndepends on the findings of the evaluation by the sleep specialist.   \\nRemoving tonsils and adenoids that are blocking the airway is done frequently, especially in children.  Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is a surgery for adults that removes the tonsils, uvula, and part of the soft palate.   Tracheostomy is a surgery used rarely and \\nonly in severe sleep apnea when no other treatments have been successful.   A small hole is made in the windpipe, and a tube is \\ninserted.

Y\\nour doctor may ask you to keep a sleep \\ndiary for a few weeks. (See “Sample Sleep Diary” on page 54.) Your doctor also may ask you whether you have any symptoms of sleep apnea or restless legs syndr\\nome, such as loud snoring, \\nsnorting or gasping, morning headaches, tingling or unpleasant sensations in the limbs that are relieved by moving them, and jerking of the limbs during sleep.

People who have RLS feel a need to stretch or move their legs to get rid of the uncomfortable or painful feelings. As a result, it may be difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep.  One or both legs may be affected.  Some people also feel the sensations in their arms. These sensations also can occur when lying down or sitting for long periods of time, such as while at a desk, riding in a car, or watching a movie. \\nMany people who have RLS also have brief limb movements during \\nsleep, often with abrupt onset, occurring every 5–90 seconds. This condition, known as periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS), can repeatedly awaken people who have RLS, reducing their total sleep time and interrupting their sleep.  Some people have PLMS but have no abnormal sensations in their legs while awake. \\nRLS affects 5–15 percent of Americans, and its prevalence increases \\nwith age.  RLS occurs more often in women than men.  One study found that RLS accounted for one-third of the insomnia seen in patients older than age 60.  Children also can have RLS.  In children, the condition may be associated with symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.  However, it’s not fully known how the disorders are related.  Sometimes “growing pains” can be mistaken for RLS. \\nRLS is often inherited.  Pregnancy, kidney failure, and anemia \\nrelated to iron or vitamin deficiency can trigger or worsen RLS symptoms.  Researchers suspect that these conditions cause an iron deficiency that results in a lack of dopamine, which is used by the brain to control physical sensation and limb movements.  Doctors usually can diagnose RLS by patients’ symptoms and a telltale worsening of symptoms at night or while at rest.  Some doctors may order a blood test to check ferretin levels (ferretin is a form of iron). Doctors also may ask people who have RLS to spend a night in a sleep laboratory, where they are monitored to rule out other sleep disorders and to document the excessive limb movements. \\nRLS is treatable but not always curable.  Dramatic improvements \\nare seen quickly when patients are given dopamine-like drugs or iron supplements. Alternatively, people who have milder cases may be treated successfully with sedatives or behavioral strategies. These Common Sleep Disorders '),\n",

Avoiding caffeinated beverages also can help reduce symptoms, and certain medications (e.g., some antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) may cause RLS. If\\xa0iron or vitamin deficiency underlies RLS, symptoms may improve with prescribed iron,\\n vitamin B12, or folate supplements.  Some \\npeople may require anticonvulsant medications to control the creeping and crawling sensations in their limbs.  Others who have severe symptoms that are associated with another medical disorder or that do not respond to normal treatments may need to be treated with pain relievers. \\nNarcolepsy \\nNarcolepsy’s main symptom is extreme and overwhelming daytime sleepiness, even after adequate nighttime sleep.  In addition, nighttime sleep may be fragmented by frequent awakenings.  People who have narcolepsy often fall asleep at inappropriate times and places. Although TV sitcoms occasionally feature these individuals to generate a few laughs, narcolepsy is no laughing matter.  People who have narcolepsy experience daytime “sleep attacks” that last from seconds to more than one-half hour, can occur without warning, and may cause injury. These embarrassing sleep spells also can make it difficult to work and to maintain normal personal or social relationships. \\nWith narcolepsy, the usually sharp distinctions between being asleep \\nand awake are blurred. Also, people who have narcolepsy tend to fall directly into dream-filled REM sleep, rather than enter REM sleep gradually after passing through the non-REM sleep stages first. \\nIn addition to overwhelming daytime sleepiness, narcolepsy has \\nthree other commonly associated symptoms, but these may not occur in all people: \\nSudden muscle weakness (cataplexy). This weakness is similar \\nto the paralysis that normally occurs during REM sleep, but it lasts a few seconds to minutes while an individual is awake. Cataplexy tends to be triggered by sudden emotional reac\\xadtions, such as anger, surprise, fear ,\\n or laughter. The weakness \\nmay show up as limpness at the neck, buckling of the knees, or sagging facial muscles affecting speech, or it may cause a complete body collapse. '),\n",

People who have narcolepsy may experience \\na temporary inability to talk or move when falling asleep or \\nwaking up, as if they were glued to their beds. \\nVivid dreams. These dreams can occur when people who \\nhave narcolepsy first fall asleep or wake up. \\nThe dreams are \\nso lifelike that they can be confused with reality. \\nExperts estimate that as many as 350,000 \\nAmericans have narco\\xad\\nlepsy, but fewer than 50,000 are diagnosed. The disorder may be as \\nwidespread as Parkinson’\\ns disease or multiple sclerosis, and more \\nprevalent than cystic fibrosis, but it is less well known.  Narcolepsy is often mistaken for depression, epilepsy, or the side effects of medicines. \\nNarcolepsy can be difficult to diagnose in people \\nwho have only the symptom of excessive daytime sleepiness.  It is usually diagnosed during an overnight sleep recording (PSG) that is followed by an MSLT.  (See “How Are Sleep Disorders Diagnosed?” on page 44.)  Both tests reveal symptoms of narcolepsy—the tendency to fall asleep rapidly and enter REM\\xa0sleep early, even during brief naps. \\nNarcolepsy can develop at any age, but \\nthe symptoms tend to appear first during adolescence or early adulthood. About 1 of every 10 people who have narcolepsy has a close family member who has the disorder, suggesting that one can inherit a tendency to develop narcolepsy. Studies suggest that a substance in the brain called hypocretin plays a key role in narcolepsy.  Most people who have narcolepsy lack hypocretin, which promotes wakefulness.  Scientists believe that an autoimmune reaction—perhaps triggered by disease, viral illness, or brain injury— specifically destroys the hypocretin-generating cells in the brains of people who have narcolepsy. \\n'),\n",

In the meantime, most people who have narcolepsy find some to all of their symptoms relieved by various drug treatments.  For example, central nervous system stimulants can reduce daytime sleepiness. Antidepressants and other drugs that suppress REM sleep can prevent muscle weakness, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreaming.  Doctors also usually recommend that people who have narcolepsy take short naps (10–15 minutes) two or three times a day, if possible, to help control excessive daytime sleepiness. \\nParasomnias (Abnormal Arousals) \\nIn some people, the walking, talking, and other body functions normally suppressed during sleep occur during certain sleep stages. Alternatively, the paralysis or vivid images usually experienced during dreaming may persist after awakening. These occurrences are collectively known as parasomnias and include confusional arousals (a mixed state of being both asleep and awake), sleep talking, sleep walking, night terrors, sleep paralysis, and REM sleep behavior disorder (acting out dreams).  Most of these disorders— such as confusional arousals, sleep walking, and night terrors—are more common in children, who tend to outgrow them once they become adults.  People who are sleep-deprived also may experience some of these disorders, including sleep walking and sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis also commonly occurs in people who have narco\\xadlepsy.  Certain medications or neurological disorders appear to lead to other parasomnias, such as REM sleep behavior disorder, and these parasomnias tend to occur more in elderly people.  If you or a family member has persistent episodes of sleep paralysis, sleep walking, or acting out of dreams, talk with your doctor. Taking measures to assure the safety of children and other family members who have partial arousals from sleep is very important. Common Sleep Disorders '),\n",

It offers tips on how to start and stay on the eatingplan, as well as a week of menus and some recipes. The menus and recipes are given for two levels of daily sodium consumption—2,300 and 1,500 milligrams per day. Twenty-three hundred milligrams is the highest level considered acceptable by the NationalHigh Blood Pressure Education Program. It is also the highestamount recommended for healthy Americans by the 2005 “U.S.Dietary Guidelines for Americans.” The 1,500 milligram level canlower blood pressure further and more recently is the amount recommended by the Institute of Medicine as an adequate intakelevel and one that most people should try to achieve.\\nThe lower your salt intake is, the lower your blood pressure.\\nStudies have found that the DASH menus containing 2,300 mil-ligrams of sodium can lower blood pressure and that an even lower level of sodium, 1,500 milligrams, can further reduce bloodpressure. All the menus are lower in sodium than what adults in the United States currently eat—about 4,200 milligrams per day in men and 3,300 milligrams per day in women.\\nThose with high blood pressure and prehypertension may benefit \\nespecially from following the DASH eating plan and reducing theirsodium intake.'),\n",

High blood pressure oftenhas no warning signs or symptoms. Once it occurs, it usually lasts alifetime. If uncontrolled, it can lead to heart and kidney disease,stroke, and blindness.\\nHigh blood pressure affects more than 65 million—or 1 in 3—\\nAmerican adults. About 28 percent of American adults ages 18 andolder, or about 59 million people, have prehypertension, a conditionthat also increases the chance of heart disease and stroke. Highblood pressure is especially common among African Americans,who tend to develop it at an earlier age and more often than Whites.It is also common among older Americans—individuals with normalblood pressure at age 55 have a 90 percent lifetime risk for develop-ing high blood pressure.\\nHigh blood pressure can be controlled if you take these steps: \\n■Maintain a healthy weight.\\n■Be moderately physically active on most days of the week.\\n■Follow a healthy eating plan, which includes foods lower in sodium.\\n■If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.\\n■If you have high blood pressure and are prescribed medication, \\ntake it as directed.\\nAll steps but the last also help to prevent high blood pressure.3What Is High Blood Pressure?What Is High \\nBlood Pressure?\"),\n",

Box 4 on page10 gives the number of servings for 1,600, 2,600, and 3,100 calories.\\nThe DASH eating plan used along with other lifestyle changes can\\nhelp you prevent and control blood pressure. If your blood pressureis not too high, you may be able to control it entirely by changingyour eating habits, losing weight if you are overweight, getting regular physical activity, and cutting down on alcohol.

Reading the “Getting Started” suggestions in box 13 should\\nhelp you along the way. The DASH eating plan requires no specialfoods and has no hard-to-follow recipes. One way to begin is by seeing how DASH compares with your current food habits. Use the“What’s On Your Plate?” form. (See box 14 on page 26.) Fill it in for1–2 days and see how it compares with the DASH plan. This willhelp you see what changes you need to make in your food choices.\\nRemember that on some days the foods you eat may add up to more\\nthan the recommended servings from one food group and less fromanother. Similarly, you may have too much sodium on a particularday. But don't worry. Try your best to keep the average of severaldays close to the DASH eating plan and the sodium level recom-mended for you.\\nUse the menus that begin on page 30 if you want to follow the\\nmenus similar to those used in the DASH trial—or make up yourown using your favorite foods. In fact, your entire family can eatmeals using the DASH eating plan. Use box 3 on page 8 to chooseyour favorite foods from each food group based on your calorieneeds as described in the 2005 “U.S. Dietary Guidelines forAmericans.”\\nThe Dietary Guidelines determined that the DASH eating plan is an\\nexample of a healthy eating plan and recommends it as a plan thatnot only meets your nutritional needs but can accommodate variedtypes of cuisines and special needs.\\nRemember that the DASH eating plan used along with other lifestyle\\nchanges can help you prevent and control your blood pressure.Important lifestyle recommendations for you include: achieve andmaintain a healthy weight, participate in your favorite regular physical activity, and, if you drink, use moderation in alcohol consumption (defined as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men).\\nOne important note: If you take medication to control high blood\\npressure, you should not stop using it. Follow the DASH eating planand talk with your doctor about your medication treatment. The tipsin box 15 on page 27 can help you continue to follow the DASH eating plan and make other healthy lifestyle changes for a lifetime.23What Is the DASH Eating Plan?\"),\n",

Here are some ways to\\nget started:\\nChange gradually\\n●If you now eat one or two vegetables a day, add a serving at \\nlunch and another at dinner.\\n●If you don't eat fruit now or have juice only at breakfast, add a serving to your meals or have it as a snack.\\n●Gradually increase your use of fat-free and low-fat milk and milk products to three servings a day. For example, drink milk with lunch or dinner, instead of soda, sugar-sweetened tea, or alcohol. Choose fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1 percent) milk and milk products to reduce your intake of saturated fat, total fat, cholesterol, and calories and to increase your calcium.\\n●Read the Nutrition Facts label on margarines and salad dressings to choose those lowest in saturated fat and trans fat.\\nTreat meats as one part of the whole meal, instead of \\nthe focus\\n●Limit lean meats to 6 ounces a day—all that's needed. Have only 3 ounces at a meal, which is about the size of a deck of cards.\\n●If you now eat large portions of meats, cut them back gradually—by a half or a third at each meal.\\n●Include two or more vegetarian-style (meatless) meals each week.\\n●Increase servings of vegetables, brown rice, whole wheat pasta, and cooked dry beans in meals. Try casseroles, whole wheat pasta, and stir-fry dishes, which have less meat and more vegetables, grains, and dry beans.BOX 13\"),\n",

How is this book different from  \\nother textbooks? \\nMost medical books describe a disease process and give physiological, \\nbiochemical, and other explanations for the causes and complications and \\nhow these processes can be treated. They also describe what symptoms, \\nsigns, and test results occur. When a patient presents with new symp-\\ntoms and other findings, readers must somehow work out which, of all \\nthe conditions they have read about, the patient has.  \\nThis book is different. It lists the causes of findings that are the best \\nclues (or “leads”) and then outlines some findings, which, when used in \\ncombination with the lead, suggest the diagnosis with a reasonably high \\nprobability, or confirm it.  \\nThe number of findings is usually small, for two reasons. The first is \\nthat many findings occur often in many other diseases and are therefore \\nnonspecific; it is only a few that form powerful predictors. The second \\nreason is practical—it is only possible to build up experience of small \\ncombinations of findings because it is difficult to find many patients wi th \\nthe same large combination of findings.  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataset\\\\Oxford_American_Handbook_of_Clinical_Dia.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content=' IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS xii\\nImportant questions and answers Important questions and an-swers \\nThe diagnostic findings given in this book are based mostly on an im-\\npression of what other doctors expect in the form of evidence for a diag-\\nnosis during clinical discussions (or in an evidence-based past medical \\nhistory). Ideally, these findings should have been shown to form the best \\ncombinations that identify patients who respond well to treatment com-\\npared to placebo in clinical trials. Failing this, they should be the combina-\\ntions recognized by convention as being the best (known as “diagnostic \\ncriteria”). In the absence of both these situations, one has to resort to \\nimpressions of what most physicians would think reasonable. \\nThe usefulness of suggestive findings would also require more studies on \\ntheir frequency of occurrence in association with different diagnostic criteria \\nin various clinical settings. \\n2. Does this book claim to reveal all  \\nthe mysteries of diagnosis? \\nNo—the way in which our minds work is a mystery, as is much of the \\ndiagnostic process. Diagnosis  is based on the Greek “to know through.” \\nIn the context of medicine, it is to see through the patient’s symptoms \\nand other findings to imagine and understand what may be happening in \\nterms of current theories applied to medicine. The decision of what to \\ndo is made by using the diagnosis to infer what will probably happen next \\nand how the process can be changed by various available interventions.  \\nPhysicians learn to do this by experience, so that as they take a history \\nand examine a patient, it “dawns” on them what may be going on, what \\nmay happen next, and what they should do. In essence, their diagnosis is \\na title or label for what they are imagining in terms of current processes \\nand future events. \\nThe process is uncertain. Philosophically, we can only show that other \\ndiagnoses or hypotheses are improbable and that the patient’s findings \\nare probably explained by only one known diagnosis. However, there \\nmay be some other processes not yet discovered by basic medical  \\nresearch, with which the patient’s findings are also compatible. There-\\nfore, the outcomes of actions based on a presumed diagnosis have to be \\nmonitored and the diagnosis and decision revised, if necessary. The proc-\\ness is often cyclical, so that the physician is supplementing the patient’s \\nown reparative and homeostatic feedback processes. \\nThe diagnostician has to be alert to new concerns, symptoms, and \\nother findings and must be able to interpret them to arrive at new diag-\\nnoses and decisions. Surgeons may have to do this as they are operating \\non a patient; what may appear to be a simple, routine procedure may \\nproduce surprises and require a quick, innovative, and skilled response. \\nDiagnosis is thus bound up with clinical management. Physicians depend \\non such rapid intuitive processes to get through their day with the speed \\nand efficiency required of them. \\nIn some cases a doctor will listen to the patient, conduct an examina-\\ntion, and decide what to do (e.g., giving a pain-relieving drug, pressing on \\na bleeding wound, or sending the patient quickly to the hospital) without '),\n",

It is only on reflection that he or she \\nwill offer an explanation and describe what was imagined subconsciously \\nat the time the decision was made. This is often described as “empirical” \\nmedicine. \\n3. What approach to diagnosis does \\nthis book describe? \\nIn addition to our private inner thoughts and diagnoses, we have to use \\ntransparent thought processes to explain to others what we are doing. \\nThis is how we explain to patients what we think is wrong and what \\nshould be done. It is also central to teamwork involving members of \\nother disciplines who have to help to provide the medical care arising \\nfrom the various diagnoses that apply to a patient. It is also essential \\nwhen handing over care to other teams, which is an increasingly prominent \\nfeature of modern medicine. \\nSo, however mysteriously the mind works, the decisions, diagnoses, and \\nevidence must also be communicated very clearly to doctors, nurses, and \\nothers in the team, the patients, and their supporters. The diagnosis may \\nalso have to be coded for clinical audit, activity analysis, and payment. The \\nevidence and reasoning must be communicated in order that others can \\nunderstand and, if necessary, continue the thought processes. This is the \\npublic, explicit form of diagnosis and decision making, in contrast to the \\nprivate, rapid, intuitive process that often leads to diagnoses and decisions \\nin the first place. \\nThe explicit diagnostic thought process can also be used to arrive at the \\ndiagnosis in the first place. This has to be done very often by those with \\nlittle experience but not infrequently by those with wide experience when \\nthey inevitably meet new situations. This book describes how this is done. \\n4. Is there is a simple concept on which \\ntransparent diagnosis is based? \\nYes—it based on the idea of small, predictive combinations of informa-\\ntion. If a group of patients with a combination of features turns out to \\nhave some diagnosis with a known frequency, then if more features are \\nadded, the frequency of the outcome in the new combination will  \\nincrease, decrease, or remain the same. However, the original frequency \\nwill represent the average of the new frequencies in the groups formed \\nby subdividing the original group. Thus, a small combination of features \\nthat predicts an outcome with a very high frequency can be very useful. \\nThis book outlines findings that form useful combinations for diagnosis \\nand thus predict the outcome of treatment. It does not specify the  \\ndetailed, logical structure of the combinations. Before this can be done, it \\nwould be necessary to conduct systematic studies during day-to-day care \\nat the same time as data are collected for analysis.  '),\n",

What are “leads,” and how are  \\nthey used? \\nAlead is a finding associated with a limited number of conditions and \\nthat is thus easier to investigate. The titles of the pages of this book \\nrepresent such leads. An unusual or disturbing symptom or physical sign \\nmay well be a good lead. In the same way, extreme results of measure-\\nment are often good leads. \\nIf the reader discovers a good lead when taking the history or examin-\\ning the patient, then in turning to the appropriate page, he or she will be \\nable to scan down the page to see if the patient has other features that \\nform a combination that point to one of the diagnoses. \\nIf the patient’s findings are compatible with a number of different  \\npredictive combinations, then these will represent the differential diagnoses \\n(provided that they are also capable of causing the presenting complaint). \\nThe approach of assembling a combination of findings by selecting items \\nof information that occur commonly in one cause, but rarely in others \\nrarely, is the probabilistic version of logic by elimination.1,2,3 Leads have \\nalso been referred to as “pivots.”4\\n6. At what point in a medical career is \\nthis book useful? \\nThis book, along with its approach, can be used throughout a medical \\ncareer. It can be used by students beginning their medical studies, to \\nlearn the principles of interpreting clinical information. It can be referred \\nto at any time during clinical clerkships, internship, or residency, when \\nassessing patients or when tackling diagnostic exercises on paper. \\nT h i s  h a n d b o o k  i s  a l s o  d e s i g n e d  t o  h e l p  p h y s i c i a n s  d e a l  w i t h  p r o b l e m s  \\nclearly by using a logical and flexible approach when they are on strange \\nterritory.

Such an \\napproach would also reduce unnecessary duplication and wasting of \\nresources, and might be used on computer systems for health care. \\n7. In what situations can this book  \\nbe used? \\nThe book can be used in a number of situations. It can be read after \\ntaking a history, examining a patient, and arriving at diagnoses and a \\nmanagement plan. The latter will include a positive finding summary or \\nproblem list, proposed investigations, and initial treatments. The positive \\nfindings can then be looked up in this book, beginning with those most \\nstriking or severe, to see if you have considered important causes and \\nways of confirming them. \\nThis book can be used for problem-based learning. Thus, after trying to \\nsolve a problem without the aid of this book, use it for a second attempt. \\nMake your own notes on the blank pages if you find that a cause or \\nimportant finding has not been mentioned. As with other Oxford Hand-\\nbooks, we would welcome suggestions. Some diseases are only common \\nin examinations (partly because they provide physical signs that are relia-\\nbly stable over many years). They are often rare in clinical practice  \\nexcept in specialized departments. \\n8. How does the structure of the book \\nwork? \\nThe main part of the book describes the findings that can emerge at each \\nstep of the history and examination and as a result of doing the prelimi-\\nnary tests. Each page will describe the list of the main differential diagno-\\nses to be considered for a lead that is starting point for the diagnostic \\nreasoning process. Alongside each diagnosis there is an outline of the \\ntypical evidence that suggests the diagnosis with sufficient probability to \\njustify doing confirmatory tests. It may then outline the typical results of \\ndoing these tests to provide reasonable evidence to confirm the diagno-\\nsis. There will be some duplication in that these details will be repeated \\nfor the reader’s convenience each time the diagnosis is listed as a cause \\nof a symptom or sign. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataset\\\\Oxford_American_Handbook_of_Clinical_Dia.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content=' \\n \\n IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS xvi \\n  \\n9. How can the book be used as a  \\nlearning tool? \\nWhen you read the book, imagine that you have come across a  patient \\nwith the finding(s) forming the title for that page. Cover the differential \\ndiagnoses on the left-hand side of the page with your hand or a book-\\nmark to see if you can predict the diagnosis from reading the findings on \\nthe right-hand side of the page. This is the direction in which your mind \\nshould be working when trying to think about diagnosis and solve diag-\\nnostic dilemmas. You can then read the whole page for an overview. You \\nshould always try to recall what you know already about something \\nbefore reading about it, in order to learn in an integrated way. \\n10. Can a transparent diagnostic  \\napproach improve the diagnostic \\naccuracy of an experienced  \\nphysician? \\nIt is a common experience that if we try to give a carefully reasoned \\njustification for an intuitive opinion, especially by writing it down, we  \\nmay find that we cannot justify it easily and will reconsider our opinion.  \\nConversely, if our explicitly reasoned justification confirms our intuitive \\nopinion, then we will feel more confident in its success.  \\nThis is illustrated by what happened when data assembled by t he late \\nProfessor Tim de Dombal were analyzed. The surgeon was correct in his \\nintuitive diagnosis 235/300 = 78.3% of the time, and a transparent, logical \\napproach using small combinations of findings was correct 230/300 = 76.6% \\nof the time. However, the surgeon and transparent, logical approach agreed \\nabout the diagnosis in 221/300 of cases. When there was agreement in these \\n221 instances, the diagnosis was correct in 200/221 = 90.5% of cases.1 \\n11. How does this approach relate to \\ndiagnostic algorithms? \\nThe suggestive and confirmatory evidence under each diagnosis represents \\nthe findings that would have been chosen by following the path down a \\ndiagnostic algorithm in order to arrive at the diagnosis. However, instead \\nof locking the reader into a fixed sequence, this book allows the reader \\nto scan the different diagnoses and recognize which findings on the page \\nbest fit those of the patient. \\nIn a sense, each page provides a form of pattern-recognition table. The \\nconfirmatory evidence should be compatible with only one diagnosis. \\n \\n1. Llewelyn, DEH, (1988). Assessing the validity of diagnostic tests and clinical decisions. MD \\nthesis.

How comprehensive is the  \\ninformation about each diagnosis? \\nThere is not enough space in a handbook of this kind to describe all the \\ncombinations of evidence that might point to a diagnosis. Therefore, each \\npage describes some of the differential diagnoses and, for each of these, \\nan outline of typical findings that are suggestive and confirmatory. This \\nprovides a start to which further information can be added by the reader \\nin the Oxford Handbook spirit. \\nThe diagnostic causes of a lead are usually listed in the order of their fre-\\nquency in those patients with the lead. (Sometimes they are grouped to-\\ngether because of causal similarity, e.g., into cardiac causes and not in an \\norder of frequency.) A major factor in determining this order is the preva-\\nlence of those with the diagnosis in the overall study population. Therefore, \\nthe order of the diagnoses on the page may vary between clinical settings. \\nReaders should try to insert the order number of the diagnostic causes in \\nterms of probability in their own clinical settings. \\n13. What is meant by facts, opinions,  \\nand evidence  in the book? \\nEvidence  is an account of real events that supports what we believe. It is \\nmade up of facts. Thus, facts are also accounts of real events. Real events \\nare transient and immediately become memories that are easily forgotten \\nor distorted. Evidence is usually shared with others, thus it must be  \\nrecorded carefully using conventions that other people will also accept. \\nOne of these conventions is that the record of a fact must bear a time \\nand date so it can be corroborated (e.g., by questioning other witnesses). \\nIf such details are omitted, this may arouse suspicion, even if th ere is no \\nneed to seek corroboration. In many cases a listener would judge the \\nprobability of corroboration or of replicating the finding to be high. \\nMost evidence takes the form of contemporaneous notes or printed \\nnumerical values from a measuring device. In other cases, a finding is pre-\\nserved, e.g., an X-ray, a photograph, or a video recording with sound. \\nHowever, all these methods are subject to error or some other distortion, \\nand the method of detection and recording has to follow appropriate \\nconventions if they are to be accepted by others.  \\nIn this book, evidence  is described as being “suggestive” or “confirmatory” \\nof a diagnosis and when it is applied to a real patient, will have to bear a \\ndate or time. Evidence about a single patient may be termed “particular \\nevidence,” whereas evidence about a group of patients may be termed \\n“general evidence.” \\nThe principle of replication also applies to general evidence. For example, \\n1/77 (1.3%) of normotensive diabetic patients taking placebo with an  \\nalbumin excretion rate (AER) starting between 20 and 40 μg/minute had \\nnephropathy within 2 years.1 This would be general scientific evidence.  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataset\\\\Oxford_American_Handbook_of_Clinical_Dia.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content=' \\n \\n IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS xviii \\nIf we took the pile of 77 records from the study, we could simulate  \\nrepeat studies by selecting a set of notes at random from the pile, exam-\\nining it, returning it, and doing this 77 times. If a large number of such \\nsimulated studies were done, then from the binomial distribution there \\nwould be a 99.7% chance of finding nephropathy in 0/77 or 1/77 or 2/77 \\nor 3/77 or 4/77 of patients with a controlled BP in different simulated \\nstudies (i.e., from 0% [0/77] to 5.2% [4/77]). There is thus a 99.7% chance \\nof replicating the finding of 1/77 by a repeat result being between 0/77 \\nand 4/77 inclusive.  \\nBy comparison, the standard 95% confidence interval for 1/77 is 0.03% \\nto 7.02% and the 99% confidence interval for 1/77 is 0.01% to 9.37%. \\nHowever, the probability of replication between two limits is more simi-\\nlar to the percentage confidence interval if the numbers in the study are \\nhigh and the observed result is near to 50%. \\nA fact is an account of an observation, but an opinion  is a prediction \\nabout something that has not yet (or even cannot) be seen. If an opinion \\ncan be checked by observation, it can be founded on evidence (it is \\nsubstantiable). If it can never be observed, it cannot be founded on evi-\\ndence (it is unsubstantiable). An opinion can thus be substantiated if it \\ncan be based on past evidence.  \\nFor example, if an individual patient’s AER is between 20 and 40 \\nμg/minute, then an opinion that such a diabetic patient with a controlled \\nBP is unlikely to develop nephropathy would be well founded or substan-\\ntiated by the fact that of 77 such past patients, only 1 went on to get \\nnephropathy in a particular study. \\n14. How do these ideas relate to  \\nstatistical and other models of  \\ndiagnosis? \\nStatistical and other mathematical methods (many based on Bayes theorem) \\ngenerate a value much like a diagnostic test. These may be calculated \\nestimates of some biological value, e.g., a calculated glomerular filtration \\nrate, a diagnostic score, or an estimated probability. All these numerical \\noutputs of a calculation can be treated in the same way as direct meas-\\nurements by calibrating them against the frequency of some outcome \\n(e.g., the proportion who progress to requiring dialysis within 2 years—\\nsee Fig. 2.3). The numerical outputs could then be incorporated into the \\nsuggestive or confirmatory evidence for the diagnosis. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1. Llewelyn DEH, Garcia-Puig J (2004).

Yet it is precisely at this time that developing the \\nclinical scenario is most awkward. Simply put, the problem is one of \\nincompatibility of two sets of knowledge. \\nMedical knowledge comprises millions of facts. It must be organized \\nby disease state and by pathophysiology. Information is easily retrieved, \\nonce mastered, if organized by disease state or pathogenesis. Clinical \\ninformation, obtained from a single patient during the interview and \\nexam, similarly comprises hundreds, if not thousands, of facts.  \\nThe patient, however, rarely presents as a disease. More commonly, \\nthe patient presents as a loosely constructed chain of complaints, each \\nfurther from the chief complaint, and each of uncertain relation to the \\nother. A patient may present with a chief complaint, accompanied by an \\nelaborate psychological construct to prevent disclosure of painful events. \\nOccasionally the patient presents with a chief complaint accompanied by \\na distressingly detailed essay on bodily functions and their manifestations \\nin each of the special senses.  \\nIt is the clinician’s job to manage the information obtained during the \\ninterview in such a way that the patient’s problem is accurately assessed. \\nThe difficulty lies in the fact that the vast medical information the student \\ncommands is not in an accessible format during the clinical situation. \\nTo a certain extent, medical information must be relearned in a clinical \\nformat, such as clinical presentations. In other words, the polymerization \\nof deoxyhemoglobin into a gelatinous network that contorts the other-\\nwise supple red cell into an unyielding and obstructive mass can present as \\nfever and shortness of breath in an African-American man (sickle chest \\nsyndrome). Relearning the body of information mastered in medical \\nschool as presentations is neither efficient nor, in most cases, necessary. \\nFortunately, there are techniques that enable the budding clinician to \\nmake the two bodies of knowledge—the medical information and the \\npatient data—compatible. These techniques are simply thought proc-\\nesses. They aren’t unique to medicine, but they comprise much of the \\nfabric of clinical experience. Paradoxically, many seasoned clinicians cannot \\nexplain such thought processes well. They are “second nature,” like \\nriding a bike or driving a car, only the skills involved pertain to cognition, \\nrather than movement. Students generally learn them by trial and error, \\nby emulation of their instructors, and simply as a product of experience. \\n '),\n",

The first is the process of arriving at the \\ndiagnosis and the second is explaining and checking the diagnosis. It is \\nvery important to recognize this difference. The process of discovering \\nthe diagnosis is performed in a systematic way, but the urgency of the \\nsituation or disruptive events may frequently result in the planned  \\nsequence being abandoned.  \\nDiagnoses are arrived at in the form of imagined processes with dif-\\nferent degrees of certainty. These diagnoses, some tentative, others more \\ncertain, will suggest relevant tests to clarify the situation and treatments \\nto try and reverse or divert the course of the diagnoses. This first thought \\nprocess depends on the individual diagnostician’s imagination combined \\nwith different types of thought processes ranging from rapid pattern \\nrecognition for familiar issues to a more tentative approach when in \\nunfamiliar territory.  \\nStudents will almost always be in unfamiliar territory at first, and no \\ndoctor can become familiar with every situation. Doctors who see many \\npatients will come across unfamiliar problems more often, making medi-\\ncal practice a constant challenge and highlighting the need for a more \\nmethodical checking process. \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataset\\\\Oxford_American_Handbook_of_Clinical_Dia.pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='CHAPTER 1 The diagnostic process 4 \\nProblem-solving skills \\nInformation processing is a primary goal of the physician–patient interaction. \\nIt proceeds in three phases: data processing, hypothesis generation, and \\ncreation of a differential diagnosis. The division between these phases is \\nsomewhat artificial, but it is practical. \\nData processing \\nImmediately after the patient encounter, and possibly after reviewing \\nsome basic labs and radiographic studies, an accounting of all positive and \\nnegative findings takes place. During this phase, the clinician undertakes \\nthe process of collecting and examining all the “findings,” or data, and \\nanalyzing them to look for a common relationship between them. By \\ntrying to fit these findings together to make a more accurate hypothesis, \\nthe top (or most likely) diagnoses will emerge from this process. Toward \\nthat end, a positive finding is an abnormal finding in the patient;  \\na negative finding is either a normal finding that was expected to be \\nabnormal, or the absence of a positive finding that was expected to be \\npresent. \\nDuring early attempts at this type of data analysis, we suggest that you \\ncreate a table to help you master this process. First, make a list of all \\npositive and negative findings. This step involves the following: \\n- Listing all positive and negative symptoms \\n- Listing all positive and negative physical findings \\n- Listing all positive and negative laboratory findings \\nFor example, a positive finding in a patient with chest pain is that the pain \\nis closely associated with exertion and relieved with rest. A negative \\nfinding in such a patient would be the absence of relief of the pain with \\nnitroglycerin (because one would expect such a response with chest pain \\nfrom coronary artery disease). Data processing is also the first step in \\ngeneration of a problem list. \\nAlso, consider each of the following attributes of findings: \\n- Assessment of relevance to the chief complaint. Each finding is exam-\\nined for its relevance by classifying it as definitely relevant, possibly \\nrelevant, or irrelevant (separate problem). \\n- Assessment of reliability (certainty) of each finding. It is normal for \\nfindings to be equivocal. Inexperienced clinicians will have many more \\nequivocal findings than will seasoned clinicians, simply because of their \\nlack of experience. However, not all equivocal findings pertain to  \\nexperience of the clinician. For example, a heart murmur may be \\nequivocal to the most talented cardiologist, simply because that is the \\nnature of the human body. The important thing is to acknowledge \\nequivocal findings when they occur.  \\n- Hypothesis generation. This process begins during the patient  \\nencounter, often within the first few minutes after the interaction has \\nstarted. While the clinician is still recording factual information (either \\nin written notes or in memory), various pieces of information rise to \\nthe surface.  '),\n",

Such skills allow the clinician to process and refine the data as \\nthey are obtained. Seasoned clinicians can perform most of thei r problem-\\nsolving skills during this phase, and the student will be increas ingly able to \\ndo so with experience and practice.  \\nThe goal of this phase is to develop a hypothesis or working diagnosis \\n(3–4 diagnoses) that might explain the patient’s presentation. This working \\ndiagnosis will generate a set of questions that the clinician needs to ask. \\nThese questions will depend on the manifestations that the disease is \\nexpected to produce in a patient.  \\nNote that hypothesis generation is not answer generation. The process \\nsimply allows the clinician to prioritize possibilities. Clinical decision-making \\nis derived from medical knowledge, personal theories, assumptions, experi-\\nence, traditions, and lore, and this mental strategy is sometimes called \\nmedical heuristics, such as “gestalt” and “string along.”  \\nSkills used during hypothesis generation include consideration of \\ndemographics and chief complaint, the limited survey, and pattern recog-\\nnition. We will explore the use of each of these tools briefly. \\nDemographics and the chief complaint \\nTaking into account what is epidemiologically most likely in a given popu-\\nlation, a small amount of information can yield surprisingly accurate \\nhypotheses.  \\nFor example: \\n- 32-year-old woman with polyarthritis l rheumatoid arthritis  \\n- 28-year-old man with thrush l acquired immune deficiency syndrome \\n(AIDS) \\nAlthough gender, ethnic, and racial differences are generally de-emphasized \\nto prevent discrimination, in some cases, they are a valid or even necessary \\nconsideration:  \\n- 28-year-old African-American woman with hilar adenopathy l sarcoi-\\ndosis. (In the United States, sarcoidosis affects blacks 10–20 times \\nmore commonly than it does whites. In Europe, the disease more \\ncommonly affects whites.) \\n- 22-year-old woman of Mediterranean descent with hemolytic anemia \\nl glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency \\nIt is important to consider, however, that the reason for the racial or \\ngender differences may have been biased in the original observations, as \\nis the case for coronary artery disease in women. \\n '),\n",

All formats \\nshould be used when doing a survey because a single format does not \\ncover everything.  \\nOrgan system \\nThough these are somewhat artificially divided, they are easily recalled \\nand understood, allowing access to a comprehensive database. \\nAnatomy \\nAn anatomy survey is similar to one of an organ system, but concerns the \\n“finer points” of anatomy. An anatomy survey lends itself well to the \\nsurgical specialties. For example, when considering the differential diag-\\nnosis of nausea and vomiting, consider lesions in the external auditory \\ncanal, as the general somatic afferent fibers from this area are carried by \\nthe vagus nerve, which also carries parasympathetic fibers to the upper \\ngastrointestinal (GI) tract. \\nPathogenesis \\nThe pathological processes that cause disease can be classified, and con-\\nsideration of this classification is helpful in generating hypotheses and \\ndifferential diagnoses. “VITAMIN C” is one useful mnemonic for recalling \\nthese mechanisms of disease: \\nV = vascular \\nI = infectious \\nT = toxic or traumatic \\nA = autoimmune \\nM = metabolic \\nI = idiopathic (some call it inflammatory) \\nN = neoplastic or nutritional \\nC = congenital or genetic \\nPattern recognition  \\nThe expression “when you hear hoof beats don’t think zebras” is a  \\nreminder that common diagnoses are common and should be considered \\nf i r s t .

It may help to think \\nabout each diagnosis you consider in the context of whether it is a  \\ncommon or uncommon illness and whether it is a typical or atypical pres-\\nentation.

Establish the relationship between findings, which may be inter-\\ndependent or mutually exclusive.  \\nFindings may also be “lumped” instead of “split.” Lumping is  the most \\nefficient way to begin the problem-solving process and consists of com-\\nbining as many findings as possible into a single category. Splitting the \\nfindings into the most appropriate category is a process that “keeps the \\nclinician honest.” Specifically, the findings should be attributed to the \\ncorrect cause. An important rule is that a younger patient will tend to \\nhave only one problem explaining all manifestations, whereas an older \\npatient may have multiple problems, each contributing to the presentation. \\nFor example, consider the syndrome of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, \\nfever, and leg pain. When initially considering this group of symptoms, \\nmany clinicians would propose a pulmonary embolism (PE) as the etiology : \\ndyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and fever are related to the PE, and the leg \\npain is from the deep vein thrombosis that caused the PE. However, \\ndyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and leg pain could also represent \\npneumococcal pneumonia in a patient, who has leg pain attributed to a \\nbasketball injury the day prior to presentation. The choice between these \\n(and other) scenarios might rest on the patient’s age or past medical his-\\ntory, or on other features of the history or physical.  \\nSome forms of pattern recognition are described next. \\nClusters \\nThis is a group of findings that, when found together, have a rela tively \\nhigh positive predictive value (i.e., they are specific) for a given finding. \\nFor example: \\n- Tremors + tachycardia + weight loss = hyperthyroidism \\n- Polyuria + polydipsia + polyphagia = hyperglycemia \\n- Polyuria + constipation + lethargy = hypercalcemia \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataset\\\\Oxford_American_Handbook_of_Clinical_Dia.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='CHAPTER 1 The diagnostic process 8 \\nSyndrome recognition \\nSyndromes are more specific than clusters—i.e., they are more likely  \\nto have only one cause. Often, they are given names or eponyms, For \\nexample: \\n- Horner’s syndrome:  ptosis, miosis, enophthalmos, anhidrosis  \\nipsilaterally \\n- Superior vena cava syndrome:  elevated jugular venous pressure, visible \\nanastamotic veins, and reversal of flow of the supraumbilical veins \\nGestalt \\nWhile this is a form of cluster, the emphasis is on the relative ease of \\nrecognition of the whole picture, rather than a more laborious construc-\\ntion of its parts. The suffix “-oid” allows the term to be used with suffi-\\ncient (lack of) precision. The actual diagnosis of a syndrome or disease \\ndepends on the component parts and is associated with greater specificity. \\nFor example:  \\n- Cushingoid habitus  = centripetal obesity \\n- Cushing’s syndrome  consists of truncal obesity, hypertension, fatigability, \\namenorrhea, hirsutism, purple abdominal striae, edema, glucosuria, and \\nosteoporosis.  \\n- Cushing’s disease  (as described by Cushing accompanying a basophilic \\npituitary tumor) refers to this syndrome when the cause is specifically  \\na pituitary tumor. Note the increasing specificity from “Cushingoid” to \\n“Cushing’s syndrome” to “Cushing’s disease. \\nFinding a “key clue”  \\nThis will be a “maximally” specific clue, almost pathognomonic for a \\ndiagnosis in question—for example, the presence of splinter hemor-\\nrhages in the proximal nail beds in bacterial endocarditis. If the other \\nfindings fit, then you probably have the diagnosis. If they don’t, then look \\nfurther. (Such specific clues are not that common.) \\nTemplate matching \\nIn this technique, the clinician knows intimately all of the manifestations \\nof a particular disease. She or he will then try to fit the findings of the \\npatient into the possible presentations of that disease. Think of the disease  \\nin question as a blueprint, and the findings are added into the blueprint in \\nsuch a way that they ultimately fit the template. This technique is the one \\nmost used by subspecialists, who perform consults to determine whether \\na patient has a particular disease or not. It is based on the fact that diseases \\npresent in multitudes of ways, for reasons that are not always apparent. \\nWeight of evidence \\nWhen all the findings do not neatly support a diagnosis, one assesses \\nwhere the “weight of the evidence” lies. In other words, if most of the \\nfindings support endocarditis, but the blood cultures are negative, the \\npatient is still considered to have endocarditis. However, diagnostic \\nerrors can be made when using this technique. See discussion in Dynamic \\nDiagnoses and the Possibility of Cognitive Error, p. 12. '),\n",

Consider, however, that the two clues may be unrelated. \\nUse of algorithms \\nAlgorithms are specific for the symptom being addressed. Experienced \\nclinicians use these all the time but keep them recorded only in their \\nminds. Such algorithms that are in frequent use are generally too com-\\nplex to be printed easily (because the branch points are highly detailed). \\nHowever, simplified versions are very amenable to students’ use, and can \\nbe sought on a case-by-case basis through each subspecialty. \\n“String-together technique” \\nThis technique involves linkage of one finding to another, e.g. dyspnea \\nand chest pain in a blind, 56-year-old man who was completely healthy \\nuntil he developed severe back pain from a ruptured disc. Heavy ibupro-\\nfen use for the pain led to gastric ulceration with subsequent blood loss. \\nThe blood loss manifested as melena (black stools), but was unapparent \\nto the patient because of his sight impairment. The anemia became so \\nprofound (hemoglobin of 4) that he developed dyspnea and chest pain \\nwithout having a significant degree of coronary atherosclerosis. \\nGeneration of a differential diagnosis \\nThe top diagnoses are prioritized in two ways: the most likely diagnoses \\nand the most important ones (i.e., urgent or life threatening). The primary \\ndiagnosis (the one suspected most) is usually presented first, with support-\\ning evidence.  \\nHowever, occasionally, there is a diagnosis that is urgent and this \\nshould be presented first, even though it is less likely than the primary \\ndiagnosis. For example, consider a 40-year-old female with abdominal \\ncramping and uterine bleeding.  If the history and exam suggest the possi-\\nbility of an ectopic pregnancy, this diagnosis should be listed first, even \\nthough the more likely diagnosis is uterine fibroadenomas.  \\nFrequently, there are still some discrepant details in the primary  \\ndiagnosis. Early in the evaluation of a patient, there may be missing data, \\nand the case cannot be made convincingly for the primary diagnosis. \\nThen, other diagnoses should be discussed systematically, as alternative \\ndiagnoses.  \\nA seasoned clinician will be able to generate a primary diagnosis quickly, \\nbut, as discussed below, cognitive bias may adversely impact the consid-\\neration of other diagnoses. It is usually best to consider at least three \\ndiagnoses. A good habit is to consider diagnoses broadly enough to include \\nat least three organs or categories of disease.  \\n '),\n",

It is a dynamic process. It is important \\nto realize that the techniques described above, including pattern recogni-\\ntion, “gestalt,” and template matching, are critical to the efficient function \\nof busy clinicians and are developed over time. These methods can be \\nregarded as a diagnostic snapshot of what is happening at a particular \\npoint in time. However, the patient’s illness is a dynamic process that \\nchanges with time. Changes in the patient’s status and new laboratory \\nand imaging data provide more information that needs to be accounted \\nfor in the evolving diagnosis and care process.  \\nDiagnosis reflects the clinician’s knowledge, clinical acumen, and problem- \\nsolving skills. In everyday practice, clinicians use expert skills to arrive at a \\ndiagnosis, often taking advantage of various mental shortcuts known as \\nheuristics. Although the final “working diagnosis” (usually the primary \\ndiagnosis) expedites the management plan, it is a temporary diagnosis \\nwith much missing data.  \\nThe heuristics described above, such as the “string-along” method and \\n“gestalt,” also lend themselves to cognitive errors, i.e., failures of percep-\\ntion and cognitive bias. Interestingly, cognitive errors are only rarely due \\nto lack of medical knowledge.  \\nGraber et al. studied 100 cases of diagnostic error identified through \\nautopsy discrepancies, quality assurance activities, and voluntary reports.1 \\nThey found that the underlying contributions to error fell into three \\nnatural categories: “no fault” (no identified process), system related \\n(related to health system–based processes), and cognitive. In their study, \\nthe most common cognitive errors involved defective synthesis. Prema-\\nture closure, i.e., the failure to continue considering reasonable alterna-\\ntives after a primary diagnosis is reached, was the single most common \\ncause.  \\nThis highlights the importance of recognizing that diagnosis is a  \\ndynamic process. One example given in the study was a wrong diagnosis \\nof musculoskeletal pain after a motor vehicle accident; a ruptured spleen \\nwas eventually found. Other common causes of cognitive error in Graber \\net al.’s study included faulty context generation, misjudging the salience \\nof findings, faulty perception, and errors arising from the use of heuristics. \\nOverall, inadequate knowledge was least common.  \\nFaulty context generation, or failure to consider aspects of the pa-\\ntient’s situation that are relevant to the diagnosis, can be devastating. \\n \\n1 Graber ML, Franklin N, Gordon R (2005).

However, \\nmild anemia was missed at initial diagnosis, and the patient died at home \\n2 days later from a perforated gastric ulcer.  \\n \\nPatient encounters with initial care providers in internal medicine,  \\nfamily practice, and emergency medicine have the greatest likelihood of \\ndiagnostic uncertainty and the greatest possibility of delayed or missed \\ndiagnoses. However, all specialties are vulnerable to cognitive erro r. This \\nwas discovered in findings from several benchmark studies of medical \\nerror.2–4 \\nAn important example of cognitive error is anchoring bias , the ten-\\ndency to lock onto salient features in the patient’s initial presentation too \\nearly in the diagnostic process, then failing to adjust the initial impression \\nin light of later information. This cognitive error can be made worse by \\nconfirmation bias , the tendency to look for confirming evidence to sup-\\nport the working diagnosis rather than looking for evidence to refute it, \\ndespite the latter being more persuasive and definitive.  \\nAnother common type of cognitive bias is gender bias , the tendency to \\nbelieve that gender is a determining factor in the probability of diagnosis \\nor a particular disease when no such predisposition basis exists. Gen erally, \\nthis results in overdiagnosis in the favored gender and underdiagnosis  of \\nthe neglected gender.5 \\nUnderstanding that we are all susceptible to cognitive errors, it is  \\nimportant to consider and record more than one diagnosis from the very \\nbeginning of the patient encounter. We suggest an organized data proc-\\nessing of the accumulated information, and documentation of not only \\nthe features of the history and physical that support the primary and \\nsecondary diagnoses but also the features that refute them. It is probably \\nwise to consider at least three diagnoses, preferably involving more than \\none organ system. For example, if a 37-year-old woman presents with \\nirregular, heavy, vaginal bleeding, three organs or systems that might  \\nbe considered include 1) uterine, 2) hematological (low platelets), and  \\n3) endocrine (thyroid disease). \\n \\n2 Brennan TA, Leape LL, Laird NM, et al.

Information processing is an important goal of the physician–\\npatient interaction. It proceeds in three phases: data processing, hypothesis \\ngeneration, and, finally, generation of a differential diagnosis.  \\nData processing is a simple process of collecting all the “findings” and \\nthen trying to fit those findings together to make a more accurate  \\nhypothesis. Data processing is not only critical to the development of a \\ndiagnosis but also helps the development of a problem list.  \\nHypothesis generation requires the use of multiple methods of aggre-\\ngating information. These include pattern recognition techniques, such as \\n“string-along” methods and “gestalt.”  \\nGeneration of a diagnosis is a dynamic process that depends on pattern \\nrecognition and experience. The primary diagnosis (the one most suspected \\nor most life threatening) is presented first, with supporting evidence. Other \\ndiagnoses should be routinely considered and discussed systematically as \\nalternative diagnoses.  \\nClinicians use a complex method of clinical decision-making that  \\nincludes medical knowledge, experience, assumptions, and traditions as \\nhypothesis-generating shortcuts. These shortcuts allow for efficient  \\ninformation management in a time-limited encounter; however, they may \\nlend themselves to diagnostic error. Diagnostic errors occur, even with \\nexperienced clinicians. Therefore, broad differentials can mitigate some \\nof these cognitive biases that may lead to medical errors.  '),\n",

Many of these are subconscious and p oorly under-\\nstood, for example, pattern recognition.  \\nThere is also a tradition in medicine of discussing and justifying diagn o-\\nses openly. This happens during conferences on morbidity and mortality \\nand on management, for example, the clinicopathological conferences \\n(CPCs) at the Massachusetts General Hospital, which have been pub-\\nlished for many years in the New England Journal of Medicine .  \\nEddy and Clanton studied the thought processes of doctors when they \\nwere analyzing symptoms, signs, and test results at these CPCs. The \\nauthors concluded that they were searching for single items or aggre-\\ngates of information that were associated with as small a number of \\ndifferential diagnoses as possible. Any diagnosis chosen from this list \\nbecame a “hypothesis.” Eddy and Clanton referred to these hypothesis-\\ngenerating items as “pivots.”1 They were called “diagnostic leads” in \\narticles describing the mathematical basis of this reasoning process,2,3,4,5 \\nand this is what they are called in this book, which is based on the  \\ndetailed understanding described in these studies. If such a lead was only \\nassociated with one diagnosis, then it would be “pathognomonic” (i.e., a \\nnecessary condition for that diagnosis) and, thus, a part of the definition \\nof the diagnosis.  \\nIn the absence of definitive diagnostic evidence, the pivot, or diagnostic \\nlead, is used to suggest a differential diagnosis and to generate hypotheses. \\nEddy and Clanton described how experienced diagnosticians looked for \\nfurther information to try to “prune” (or rule out) some of these hypo-\\nthetical possibilities until only one was confirmed. If the remaining d iagnosis \\nwas confirmed by the combination of pivot and pruner, then the items of \\ninformation used to do this would be sufficient diagnostic criteria an d thus \\nform a part of the diagnostic definition.  \\nSuch reasoning with definitive information can be represented easily \\nwith algorithms. However, in many cases the combination would not \\nconfirm the diagnosis but only point to it with a high probability, thus \\nsuggesting it on the basis of weight of evidence.2,3,4,5 \\n \\n \\n1 Eddy DM, Clanton CH (1982).

Each page heading represents a diagnostic lead, \\nand the page contains its differential diagnoses. Alongside each of these \\ndiagnoses are the clinical findings that suggest  that the diagnosis is prob-\\nable, and the findings that confirm  it by ruling out its rival diagnoses from \\nthe group of patients with that combination. \\nIt is important to understand why the information needed to suggest \\nor confirm diagnoses is usually small. Many templates of disease have \\nmuch in common; e.g., many of the symptoms and physical signs of \\npneumonia, pulmonary embolus, and heart failure are the same. It is the \\ndifferences  that allow the diagnostician to differentiate between them. \\nThese differences are described in the pages of this book as findings that \\nsuggest or confirm diagnoses. Negative findings are also important in this \\nrole of suggesting or confirming diagnoses (but negative findings are not \\nhelpful as diagnostic leads, because people with most other diseases and \\nthose who are healthy also have them).  \\nThe descriptions alongside each diagnosis on a page are often brief  \\nbecause the differences between diagnoses may be few. This is why the \\ndiagnostic process may be difficult for the novice to master quickly but \\nlook simple in the hands of the expert, who knows what to focus on.  \\nUnlike textbooks that concentrate on describing diseases processes, \\noften in vivid and elegant detail, this book focuses on findings that are \\nuseful during the diagnostic process, to speed up the reader’s acquisition \\nof diagnostic skills. The reader is encouraged to add to this information \\nor modify it. However, little if any evidence has been collected yet to \\nsubstantiate the performance of leads and differentiators. \\nHow to use this book \\nThe book can be used in two ways. \\n1. You may browse its pages and try to guess from your knowledge of \\nanatomy or physiology the possible diagnoses linked to it. You should \\nkeep covering the column of diagnoses and test to see whether you \\ncan guess each diagnosis by reading the findings that suggest or confirm \\nit. By doing this, you will begin to acquire the type of knowledge used \\nby experienced doctors at the CPCs. \\n2. The book can also be used when solving diagnostic problems. Write \\ndown your differential diagnoses and put in brackets after each diagnosis \\nthe positive and negative findings that you think support each diagnosis. \\nLook up the patient’s positive findings in this book: they will be repre-\\nsented by page headings. If you see a diagnosis on the page that you \\nhave not considered, consider it. As you view the differential diagnoses  \\nyou have considered, look at the suggesting and confirming findings to \\nsee if you have already looked for them; if not, do so. '),\n",

It will therefore have to be interpreted in combination with \\nother findings before a single diagnosis becomes more probable or can \\nbe confirmed. These combinations may be recognized immediately as \\nhighly predictive clusters or syndromes. If not, the combination may have \\nto be assembled logically by using one of the component findings as a \\n“lead” and using the others to make up a combination that identifies a \\ngroup of patients within which all but one diagnosis is improbable or \\neliminated.  \\nEach page in Chapters 3–18 of this book is based on the conce pt of a \\nlead that is predictive of a list of differential diagnoses. The suggesting  \\nfindings on each page can be used to make a diagnosis more probable; \\nthe confirming  findings will make that diagnosis certain. The principle of \\nusing logic to assemble patterns or syndromes is as follows. \\nIf a 24-year-old man presents with acute abdominal pain localized to \\nthe right lower quadrant (RLQ) and is accompanied by guarding, then \\nthis cluster of findings suggests appendicitis. This working diagnosis might \\nbe confirmed during a laparotomy by seeing the definitive finding of a red, \\nswollen appendix and treated with appendectomy with resolution of the \\npain so that the diagnosis becomes final. \\nLogic based on proportions \\nThe same combination of findings can also be assembled logically because \\nRLQ pain would be a good short lead due to appendicitis (e.g., in 40/100 \\nof hypothetical patients with the lead), nonspecific abdominal pain (NSAP) \\n(e.g., in 60/100). Guarding occurs commonly in appendicitis but rarely in  \\nthose with NSAP, which means that the probable diagnosis is appendicitis.  \\nNote that NSAP is an example of a group of very important diagnoses. \\nThese are self-limiting conditions that resolve spontaneously before any \\ntreatment other than relief of symptoms is required. These nonspecific \\n(NS) diagnoses (e.g., NS headache, NS chest pain) are the most common \\ndiagnoses in medicine. They are confirmed by careful follow-up but typi-\\ncally present with a small number of symptoms and signs that are mild \\nand of recent onset. Learning to deal with these safely using appropriate \\nfollow-up is one of the most important diagnostic skills to be acquired. \\nDiagnostic logic using proportions is helped by choosing a lead with a \\nsmall number of diagnostic possibilities that account for a high propor-\\ntion of patients (e.g., over 95%—ideally 100% as in the above example).  \\nAnother important principle is that the low frequency of a single find-\\ning gives an upper limit for the frequency of occurrence of a combination \\nthat includes that finding. Thus, if guarding occurs in 5% x 60 = 3 of those \\nwith NSAP, then guarding with RLQ pain must occur in 3 patients or \\nfewer (as the presence or absence of RLQ pain will further subdivide the \\ngroup of 3 who have guarding).  \\nCare must be taken with the rest of the logic, however. If guarding  \\noccurs in 50% and RLQ pain also occurs in 50% of those with appendicitis, \\nit is possible that each finding occurs in different halves of the group w ith '),\n",

Under these circumstances, it would be wrong to assume \\nthat most patients with RLQ pain and guarding had appendicitis. However, \\nif guarding occurred in 95% and RLQ pain occurred in 85% of those with \\nappendicitis, then even if they occur together as infrequently as possibl e \\n(i.e., there was maximum negative statistical dependency), both have to \\noccur in at least 80% (i.e., 0.95 + 0.85 – 1 = 0.80). In terms of patient \\nnumbers, this would be at least 80% x 40 = 32 of the original 100 patients. \\nTherefore, appendicitis must occur in at least 32/(32+3) = 91% of those \\nwith RLQ pain and guarding. \\nAssumptions and estimates \\nIt is commonly assumed that findings such as guarding and RLQ pain \\noccur together by chance in conditions such as appendicitis. This can be \\nused to give an estimate of the likelihood of discovering a combination of \\nfindings in patients who have a diagnostic criterion. Thus the likelihood of \\ngetting the combination of RLQ pain with guarding in those with appen-\\ndicitis would be assumed to be 95% x 85% = 80.75%. This is called the \\nstatistical independence assumption.  \\nHowever, if RLQ pain and guarding were assumed to occur as often as \\npossible in the same patients with appendicitis (i.e., there was positive \\nstatistical dependency), then the combination would occur in 85% of \\nthose with appendicitis. \\nCentral evidence \\nOnce a diagnostic criterion is discovered (e.g., a red, swollen appendix), \\nas this does not occur in the other conditions by definition, it rules them \\nout completely. The probability of the diagnosis (e.g., of appendicitis) then \\nbecomes 100%, irrespective of the nature of the preceding findings.  \\nThus, many findings discovered in the early part of the diagnostic proc-\\ness are often not mentioned when better evidence becomes available \\nlater (even if the better evidence does not give 100% certainty). Better \\nevidence is often assumed to give a good estimate of the probability for \\nthe total evidence. This small combination of powerful evidence is often \\ncalled the “relevant” or “central” evidence. However, the patient’s original  \\npresenting complaint is always relevant because, unless it resolves, th e \\ndiagnosis does not become final. An alternative or additional diagnosis may \\nhave to be considered to explain the patient’s findings. \\nEvidence-based differential diagnosis \\nIn practice, this reasoning process is done informally and little thought is \\ngiven to the underlying rigorous, logical principles, frequencies, or simplify-\\ning assumptions. However, if we wish to practice evidence-based medicine \\nand evidence-based diagnosis, it is important that careful thought be given \\nto the underlying logical principles of diagnosis.  \\nIt will be necessary to collect data on the frequency in diagnostic leads \\nor pivots of various diagnoses. This will include clinical findings and te st \\nresults (including numerical test results) in different clinical settings. It will \\nalso be important to determine the frequencies of symptoms, signs, and \\ndistributions of numerical test results in patients with various differential \\ndiagnoses and in patients with diagnoses of different degrees of severity.

It might be helpful \\nto an epidemiologist to know the proportion of times a particular diagnosis \\nwill be confirmed in due course after the positive screening test has been \\ninvestigated to determine its cause. One can measure this proportion \\ndirectly in a study—e.g., of 12 patients who are dipstick positive for micro-\\nalbumin, 8 turn out eventually to have incipient nephropathy.  \\nHowever, instead of measuring the proportion of 8/12 directly, this  \\nfrequency of 8/12 = 0.75 is usually calculated by epidemiologists and \\nstatisticians indirectly by applying Bayes theorem to 1) an estimate of the \\nprevalence or incidence of the diagnosis, 2) the prevalence or incidence of \\nthe screening test result in the population to be studied, and 3) an estimate of \\nthe frequency of the test result in those confirmed to have the diagnosis. \\nScreening in the diagnostic setting \\nIt is not only epidemiologists who perform screening tests. These tests are \\nalso performed by primary care physicians and specialists who look after \\npopulations of patients who are asympt omatic but who have a high risk of \\ndeveloping some condition, e.g., diabetic nephropathy. If such a patient is \\nasked open questions, e.g., “Do you have any symptoms that you wish to \\ntell me about?” severe symptoms may be remembered but minor ones may \\nbe forgotten. If the patient is asked closed  questions, e.g., “Does your urine \\nfroth sometimes?” then fewer symptoms may be missed but spurious posi-\\ntive responses may be given, perhaps to agree with the doctor.  \\nSimilarly, if a detection process is made more biochemically sensitive, \\ne.g., by calling a smaller color change on the urine dipstick paper positive, \\nthen it may result in more spurious false-positive results. However, if the \\nprocess is modified by calling only a larger color test change on the urine \\ndipstick positive, it may be less biochemically (and statistically) sensitive.  \\nIf a sensitive screening test is negative, the patient is usually reassured \\nthat no further tests are necessary. However, if, for example, a preliminary \\nurine test for microalbuminuria is positive, then the confirmatory tests  \\nof three 24-hour urine collections together with urine microscopy and \\nculture may have to be done to see if early diabetic nephropathy is present.  \\nWaiting rooms and Venn diagrams \\nThe accompanying Venn diagram (Fig. 2.1) represents 20 diabetic patients \\nin a waiting room, of whom 9 are known to have incipient nephropathy. \\nTwelve patients have a positive dipstick test.

It does not matter how powerful \\na treatment might be; it will not work if it is given to the wrong patients \\nand may indeed do more harm than good by causing adverse effe cts with \\nno prospect of benefit.  \\nThe role of a physician is to decide which patients will benefit from a \\nspecific treatment or advice, and this is done by arriving at a diagnosis. \\nFor this reason, the explanation given for a treatment is bound up with \\nthe diagnosis. This applies to the explanation for how the treatment \\nchanges the imagined underlying process and to the pragmatic result of a \\nclinical trial comparing the response to treatment with that of something \\nelse. So, a perfectly valid diagnostic criterion will help to identify all those \\nand only those patients who will respond to a treatment. \\nIf only a proportion of patients respond to a treatment, then it is better \\nto subdivide the diagnosis to identify those who do and those who do \\nnot respond. For example, only a proportion of patients suffering from a \\nmyocardial infarction (MI) benefit from thrombolysis or angioplasty. \\nHowever, more patients with ST elevation do so. The diagnosis of MI has \\nthus been subdivided into ST-elevation MI with a high response rate to \\nthrombolysis or angioplasty, and non-ST-elevation MI, which identifies \\nthose who are not very responsive and thus not offered these treatments.  \\nThe ability of a diagnostic criterion to predict treatment response is \\nknown as its validity . The most valid test result for an evolving MI would \\nbe the one that identified all those, and only those, who responded  \\nto thrombolysis or angioplasty. Note that MI now envelops other diag nos-\\ntic groups or sets. This is the case for many diagnoses, diabe tes mellitus \\nbeing an important example. One of the diagnoses it envelops is incipient \\ndiabetic nephropathy. \\nIf a gold-standard test (i.e., diagnostic criterion) is based on a meas-\\nurement, another factor that needs determining is the best cutoff point. \\nFor example, the upper limit of the normal range for the albumin  \\nexcretion rate (AER) is 20 μg/min, based on samples taken from healthy \\nlaboratory volunteers.  \\nThis cutoff point is also used to decide if a diabetic patient has incipient \\ndiabetic nephropathy by assuming that all those above this level are at \\nsignificantly increased risk of nephropathy, e.g., within 2 years. However,  \\nif only a small proportion of patients with an initial rate  between 20 and \\n40 μg/min develop nephropathy (as shown in Fig. 2.3), then nephropathy \\nwill be incipient for a very few only. If the risk of nephropathy rises rap idly \\nabove 40 μg/min, this might be a more suitable cutoff point for incipient \\ndiabetic nephropathy.1  \\n \\n1 Llewelyn DEH, Garcia-Puig J (2004).

In other cases, the result of treatment \\nmay be the only practical confirmatory test.  \\nSo, if the treatment can be stopped when the initial response is not \\npromising, this is referred to as a therapeutic gold-standard test. This is \\ndone sometimes in a double-blind crossover manner—the so-called N-of-\\n1 trial.

Some diagnostic criteria are not easily ac cessible; \\nfor example, they depend on histology or an appearance at major surgery . \\nWe may thus have to begin treatment when there are no recognized \\ncriteria.  \\nFor example, most antibiotics are prescribed for a chest infection be-\\nfore it is confirmed by culturing bacteria. However, when we decide to \\ntreat, we always assume that if a randomized, controlled trial were to be \\ndone on such a group of patients, more would benefit from treatment \\nthan from placebo (but we would think so with more confidence when \\nthere is a diagnostic criterion).  \\nIf we are asked to explain why we chose that particular treatment, we \\ncould say that we imagine the presence of the disease process for the time \\nbeing. This is called a “working diagnosis.” It is equivalent to a scientific \\nhypothesis during an experiment. If the patient gets better in the ex-\\npected way and if there was no practical purpose for doing further tests, \\nthen we would then assume that we were correct. This would be called \\na “final diagnosis.” It would be the same as a hypothesis becoming a \\nscientific theory because there is no immediate intention to do another \\nexperiment to test it. \\nIn both cases, we would be citing an imagined process, knowing that it \\nwas theoretical and not proven (i.e., by direct observation of everything \\nbeing imagined). In the case of a treatment, we would not have been able \\nto prove that the patient would not have gotten better anyway without \\nthe treatment. In order to prove this, we would have to do the impossi-\\nble by turning the clock back and not giving the treatment, to see what \\nhappens.  \\nIt should also be remembered that even if diagnostic criteria are pre-\\nsent, this does not guarantee a response to treatment. Diagnostic criteria \\nare there for consistency between different doctors’ diagnoses, and they \\nalso allow randomized trials to be done and the knowledge to be shared. \\nThus, if the diagnostic criteria were chosen carefully to be valid in terms \\nof predicting outcome, then more patients would respond to treatment \\n(and fewer to placebo in a clinical trial) when using the criterion than \\nwhen not using it. If we stray away from such published clinical-trial \\ncriteria when giving treatments, then we have to accept that we are \\nguessing treatment response by extrapolation, and not basing it on for-\\nmal, documented experience in that clinical trial. \\nIf the patient failed to respond to the treatment that might lead to a \\nfinal diagnosis, then we would carry out further tests to discover if there \\nis evidence for some other diagnosis or to look for further evidence for \\nthe original diagnosis that simply did not respond to the treatment. This \\nfurther evidence might be a successful response to some other treatment \\nthat could work for the original working diagnosis.  \\n '),\n",

Sophisticated technology is there to improve the validity of \\ndiagnostic criteria in terms of their ability to predict what will happen to \\nthe patient’s symptoms. A diagnosis represents imagination that includes \\nclinical findings and test results, so it can never be proven to be true in its \\nentirety by a single test. The number of detailed imaginary models (e.g., \\nat the molecular level) under the umbrella term of diagnosis  is limited \\nonly by the human imagination. \\nScience is concerned with imaginative theories or models that can be \\ntested against observed facts, documented, and then shared with others. \\nI f  n o  a s p e c t  o f  a  t h e o r y  c a n  b e  t e s t e d  b y  a n y  f o r m  o f  o b s e r v a t i o n ,  i t  \\ncannot be the subject of scientific study.  \\nThe process of imagining more models of disease (and discarding some \\nof them because they do not fit the facts) results in scientific models \\nbecoming more detailed. One effect of this is that diagnoses may become \\nsubdivided, e.g., MI has become subdivided into ST-elevation MI respon-\\nsive to thrombolysis or angioplasty, and non-ST-elevation MI, which is not.  \\nSo a working or final diagnosis is simply the title to a model, hypothe-\\nsis, or theory that explains and connects the combination of pre-\\ntreatment facts (e.g., chest pain with ST elevation) to an outcome  \\nof treatment with or without a treatment (e.g., lowering of raised ST \\nsegments after thrombolysis). In addition to this imaginative view of \\ndiagnosis, there is also the public, logical approach, which is the main \\nsubject of this book.  \\n '),\n",

However, the diagnostician will be tryi ng \\nto imagine the presence of a dynamic process that changes with time. Thi s \\ncould be over seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years, and \\nthe response in terms of investigation and treatment has to be timed \\nappropriately. \\nThere may be several processes taking place at the same time, some \\nprogressing over years (e.g., atheromatous changes), some over minutes \\nto hours (e.g., a thrombosis in a coronary artery), some over minutes or \\nseconds (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), and others instantaneously (e.g., a \\ncardiac arrest). This means that a diagnostic process leading to treatment \\nmay have to happen repeatedly and for a number of diagnoses at the \\nsame time.  \\nIt might be more appropriate to think of the process as one of feed-\\nb a c k  c o n t r o l .

After the \\ninitial history and examination, the feedback information may come from \\nelectronic monitoring, nursing observations, ward rounds, or hospital \\nclinic or primary-care follow-up. \\nThe mechanisms of interest to the diagnostician are of three types. The \\nfirst type is mechanisms that control the internal milieu by keeping tem-\\nperature, tissue perfusion, blood gases, and biochemistry constant. The \\nsecond type is those mechanisms that control the body’s structure by \\neffecting repair in response to any damage. The third type consists of \\nthose that control the external milieu of day-to-day living.  \\nThese three types are all interdependent. If one mechanism fails, it may \\nunmask other weaknesses by causing other failures. It may not be enough \\nto treat the main failure. It is often necessary also to treat the causes a nd \\nconsequences, as they may be unable to recover on their own. For exam-\\nple, a coronary thrombosis may be treated with thrombolysis, but an y \\nresulting rhythm abnormalities may need to be treated, as well as the \\ncausative risk factors (e.g., smoking) that could result in recurrence . So \\nwhen we explain our diagnostic thought processes, it helps to think of \\neach diagnosis as a subheading with its own evidence and decision. \\nThe process of taking a history and examining a new patient may take \\nabout an hour. If the patient is acutely ill, there may have to be an urgent, \\nlife-saving diagnosis and treatment with a reassessment every few min-\\nutes until the patient is stable. The presenting complaint and a quick \\nexamination may also suggest a minor complaint such as a viral sore \\nthroat that is best managed by simple measures and by having the patient \\nreturn in a few days.

They frequently hand over care to others \\nwho have to understand what is happening, and if they agree, to continue \\nwith the plan. There is little place in all of this for mystery and obscurity, \\nwhich may arouse suspicion about the doctor’s motives or competence.  \\nAn experienced doctor would know quickly if the evidence did not \\nadd up. He or she would check with the patient to see if the presenting \\ncomplaint is accurate and to check if the evidence given justifies accepting \\nthe main diagnosis. It is also easy to see if all the necessary treatments \\nhave been given. The same can be done for all the other diagnoses.  \\nIf there is doubt about the diagnoses because there is insufficient evi-\\ndence, then other diagnoses may also have to be considered and added \\nto the list. One reason for such doubt would be if the patient still has \\nsymptoms that are slow to resolve. If there is doubt as to whether the \\nanswers are sensible, then the history and examination has to be repeated. \\nIf th e sam e find ings are d iscove red ag ain , th en the y can be s aid to have  \\nbeen corroborated or replicated. \\nEvidence is of two types. The first type is the particular  evidence  \\ndisplayed in that particular situation for a particular patient. It has to be \\ngiven with a time and place and in enough detail to allow a listener to \\nquestion the witness or to repeat the observations so that they can be \\nreplicated along with the reasoning process and decision. (The same \\nprinciples are used in the legal profession.)  \\nThe second part of the evidence is experience from many similar past \\nsituations and their outcomes, which demonstrated that a high propor-\\ntion were successful. This is general  evidence, in contrast to the particular \\nevidence. For a treatment, it would consist of what happened in a cli nical \\ntrial to some patients on the treatment and to others on a placebo or \\nsomething else. The problem is that such general or scientific ev idence is \\nnot available for much of what we do in medicine, especially when using \\ndifferent diagnostic criteria or gold-standard tests. \\nGeneral scientific evidence is based on observations made on grou ps \\nof individuals (who each have their own particular observations). If a \\nlistener is going to accept such observations as general scientific evi-\\ndence, the results and methods have to be described in sufficient detail \\nto be repeated by someone else and thus for the study result to be \\nreplicated, if necessary. If the study and its description is of high quality \\nand published in a reputable journal (which reflects the quality), then the \\nreader may not feel obliged to repeat it.  \\nOne criterion is that there was a sensible hypothesis and thus a good \\nreason for doing the study (i.e., that it was not just a chance observation). \\nAnother important criterion would be that the numbers of observations \\nmade were high, so that the statistical probability of replicating the study \\nresult was high (e.g., there was a 95% chance of getting a repeat result \\nbetween two clinically acceptable confidence limits).

Different opinions can all be \\nvalid if they are based on documented experience and framed as prob-\\nability statements with a sensible element of doubt. For example, if a \\nphysician makes a number of different predictions with 50% certainty and \\n50% turn out to be correct overall, this shows good overall judgment.  \\nDifferent members of the team can thus hold different valid opinions \\nabout a diagnosis for a particular patient on the basis of their different \\npersonal experiences. A doctor may be wrong about a prediction for a \\nparticular patient and yet be correct 75% of the time for such predic tions \\nwith a 75% probability when they are all taken together in the long run.  \\nHowever, if a single opinion has to be adopted by a team to decide \\nwhat should be done for a particular patient, then traditionally the opin-\\nion of the most senior member present is adopted (usually after this \\nperson has listened carefully to others). \\nIf an opinion is totally certain, then it implies that all other opinions \\nmust be wrong. An opinion held with certainty also raises questions \\nabout the holder’s judgment because, in the long run, it is unlikely that \\n100% of predictions will be correct. An opinion may become distorted \\nconsciously or subconsciously because the holder stands to gain person-\\nally from its implementation. It is therefore important to be able to reas-\\nsure patients and team members if there are differences of opinion.  \\nIt is also important not to confuse opinions about outcomes with rules \\nthat a team has agreed to abide by. A team member may point out that a \\nrule should be followed; this is not an overconfident opinion but a fact, if \\nit was agreed at a particular time and place. Overconfidence is also dif-\\nferent from decisiveness. One can be decisive by choosing an option with \\na low probability of success because it represents the best of a number \\nof poor options. \\nDifferences of opinion may occur because the particular facts on which \\nthey are based are different. The first thing to do when there is a differ-\\nence of opinion, therefore, is to check the particular facts for the patient \\nand, if necessary, review the methods and conventions used by the team \\nto get agreement. This process may allow facts to be replicated (see \\nTransparency and Replication, p. 30).  \\nThe second thing to do is to clarify the personal and published experi-\\nence on which the opinion and probability are based. This would include \\nthe facts that identified the group of patients who were followed and the \\ndetails of outcomes, such as the diagnostic criteria used or the treatment \\nresults. \\nClarification of the facts often leads to agreement by revealing over-\\nsights and misunderstandings or pooling of experience. Meta-analysis is a \\ntechnique for combining data from different publications. Bayesian statis-\\nticians also combine documented data with personal, undocumented, \\nsubjective experience. Decision analysis can be used to ask patients’ \\nopinions of how they would feel about different outcomes, so that this \\ncan be taken into account when interpreting the meta-analyses and the \\npersonal experiences of doctors.

Diagnosis  is derived from the Greek “to see \\nthrough” (i.e., the history, physical examination, special investiga tions, and \\nresponse to treatment).  \\nThe diagnosis must not imply that there is only some single hidden \\nprocess that needs to be discovered. The diagnosis (or diagnostic formula-\\ntion) may have to include various causes, consequences, interactions, and \\nother independent processes. As well as internal medical processes, it \\nhas to include external factors such as circumstances at home and the \\neffects on self-care, employment, and leisure.  \\nClearly, the most informative part of this broad diagnostic process will \\nbe the history. The history also enables patients and supporters to iden-\\ntify the issues that they want addressed in terms of discomfort, loss of \\nfunction, and difficulties with day-to-day existence. Gold standards for final \\ndiagnoses are best based on the outcome of patients’ symptoms combined \\nwith the result of histology, biochemistry, or some other measurements.  \\nSo, final diagnoses are often based on initial history-taking skills from which \\noutcomes can be assessed. \\nObserve normal social conventions. Introduce yourself politely and  \\ninvite the patient and any accompanying persons to do the same. Check \\ndetails such as the patient’s date of birth, address, etc.  \\nIt is then important to establish very clearly why the patient has sought \\nhelp. This is known as the chief (or presenting) complaint. Ask the patient \\nabout its severity and duration and always record this. Be prepared to act \\nimmediately to give symptomatic relief (e.g., for pain) if the patient is \\ndistressed.  \\nIn some cases, the chief complaint may not explain the decision to seek \\nhelp. The patient may be too ill, shy, guilty, or embarrassed to describe \\nwhat is happening accurately. In other cases, it may be someone else who \\nis unduly worried (e.g., the wife of a lethargic husband, parents of a child \\nor caregivers of an elderly person who can no longer cope). Be alert and \\nexplore the real reason if there is doubt. \\nHaving established the chief complaint(s), establish the factual details of \\nplace and time. It is the ability to give a place and time that establishes \\nthe complaints as facts. (Medicine shares this convention with pure sci ence \\nand law.)  \\nListen to what the patient says without prompting first, but, if neces-\\nsary, ask where they were and what they were doing when the problem \\nwas first noticed. This will help the patient to recall what happened and \\nalso stimulate your own diagnostic imagination.  \\nEstablish the speed of initial onset and subsequent change in severity \\nwith time. This helps you to imagine the kind of pathological process that \\nis taking place. An onset within seconds suggests a fit or heart rhythm \\nabnormality; over minutes, a bleed or clotting process; hours to days, an \\nacute infection; days to weeks, a chronic infection; weeks to months, a \\ntumor; and months to years, a degenerative process.

It was relieved \\nthat day by warm drinks and acetaminophen, but when she woke the \\nfollowing morning it was very severe. It was no longer relieved by \\nacetaminophen (she found swallowing very painful) and she was too \\nunwell to get up. There had been no previous sore throats. She \\nthought that her neck was getting stiff. Her friend had died of menin-\\ngococcal meningitis a few years previously and this worried her. She \\ncalled her PCP and was seen at the clinic that day. The doctor was \\nconcerned that she lived alone and looked very unwell and had her \\nadmitted to the hospital. \\n \\nThe most striking symptom in this case is the severe sore throat that is \\ngetting worse. This is an example of a feature with a short list of \\ncauses—a good lead. Most readers will have experienced a sore throat \\nand be aware that it is usually due to a viral pharyngitis, tonsillitis (due to \\na hemolytic streptococcus), glandular fever, or something else in a rela-\\ntively small proportion of cases (see p. 100). Very rarely, these causes \\ninclude the beginning of a meningococcal infection. This loomed large in \\nthe patient’s mind because of the fate of her friend. The history is com-\\npatible with all of these possibilities. \\nIf a better lead with an even shorter differential diagnosis turns up \\nlater, you may use that. Use the other findings to try to confirm one \\ncause of the shortest lead (and thus eliminate the others). Consider if the \\nremaining abnormal findings could resolve if the confirmed diagnosis \\nwere treated.

Single and small combinations of findings of this kind form the \\nfoundation of the process of arriving at a working diagnosis (i.e., until the \\ndiagnosis is final and no further tests or treatment changes are contem-\\nplated). With growing experience, you will learn to recognize more  \\ncombinations that usually point to a single or a few diagnoses and have to \\nresort less often to working through the possibilities in a conscious way, \\nusing the concepts described in this book.  \\nHowever, you will continue to be faced with new or strange situations \\nthroughout your career; this is what makes medical practice such a chal-\\nlenge. The approaches you develop early in your career to deal with new \\nsituations will stand you in good stead for the remainder of your career. \\nThe next step is the past medical history (PMH).

(Anxiety, weight loss, \\nabnormal thyroid function tests in Osler Hospital.) Taking carbimazole, \\n5 mg daily. \\n \\nThe past medical history (PMH) in this case has three components: the \\ndiagnosis, the evidence, and the management. Thyrotoxicosis is the diag-\\nnosis, which summarizes what is imagined to have happened. Anxiety, \\nweight loss, and abnormal thyroid function tests summarize the evidence  \\nfor imaging what had happened. The management  was taking carbima-\\nzole, 5 mg daily.  \\nIn many cases, the patient would not be able to provide these details \\nand they would have to be extracted from the hospital or primary care \\nrecords, in which case it is helpful to name the hospital (the fictitious \\nOsler Hospital, in this case) or primary care center or doctor responsible.  \\nIt is important to note, however, that a comprehensive PMH in this \\nformat can be written immediately after any consultation—in the hospital \\nor primary care center—with results and dates. It can be included with \\nany communication so that the recipient does not have to hunt for the \\ndetails. It is very helpful for those that follow the initial consultation (and \\nthis may include you). From time to time in the hand-written follow-up \\nnotes you may wish to take stock and write down a current PMH that \\nsets out the numbered list of diagnoses, with the evidence and management \\nin parentheses. \\nIn this case, the past history also raises the possibility of recurrence o f \\nthyroid disease causing the sore throat, but the only thyroid condition that \\nwould do this is acute thyroiditis (viral or autoimmune). This is a rare \\ncondition and is not included in lists of common causes of a sore thro at.  \\nThe message to be taken away from this example is that if the patient \\nhas had a condition in the PMH, possible links should be recalled or \\nlooked up to see if any of these could explain the presenting problem. In \\nthis sense, a history of chronic or recurrent conditions can be used as a \\nlead. So, any type of lead with a short list of possible associations should \\nbe considered. \\n '),\n",

Much of \\nthe physical examination is directed at looking for information to help to \\nconfirm or exclude the diagnostic possibilities raised by the history. It is \\ntherefore worth pausing at the end of the history to think about the \\ndiagnostic possibilities so far.  \\nIn some professional examinations, the candidate is asked only to take \\na history and to give diagnostic conclusions and a management plan of \\ninvestigations and treatment options. \\nFollowing is a reasonable differential for the main diagnosis: \\n- ? Viral pharyngitis (“?” means a reasonable probability, e.g., 20%–80%) \\n- ? Glandular fever  \\n- ? Acute follicular tonsillitis  \\n- ? Agranulocytosis due to carbimazole  \\n- ?? Meningococcal meningitis (“??” means a low probability, e.g., <20%) \\nOther diagnoses might be \\n- Inadequate domestic support currently for acute illness \\n- ?? Undiscovered type 2 diabetes mellitus \\nThe part of the physical examination to concentrate on would be the  \\nappearance of the pharynx and tonsils to see if the latter resembled \\nstrawberries and cream, suggestive of acute follicular tonsillitis, or simple \\nredness with no pus, suggestive of a pharyngitis possibly of viral origin. \\nLook for enlarged lymph nodes in the neck to support a brisk response \\nto infection, and neck stiffness that would support meningitis. \\nThe special investigations would include an urgent white cell count \\n(WBC) to see if there were absent or low white cells, confirming agranu-\\nlocytosis; raised neutrophil white cells, suggesting bacterial infection; or \\nraised lymphocytes, suggesting viral infection. Urine should be tested for \\nsugar and a fasting blood sugar test done. \\nThe immediate treatment options would be to continue the acetamino-\\nphen for pain relief and offer additional analgesia such as codeine phosp hate. \\nYou will hear of many different approaches to history taking. Make up \\nyour own mind and write out your approach on the blank pages pro-\\nvided near here or inside the front cover of the book. Write out your \\nown plan like the one in the following section. \\nAlthough there are benefits to taking a systematic approach, especially \\nif you are a student or doctor faced with an unfamiliar problem, consulta-\\ntions may have to be very rapid with shortcuts. The circumstances may \\ndisrupt any attempt to be systematic, for example, when examining a \\nfractious child, or when faced with several injured or very sick patients.  \\nTo be effective, you should think in an orderly way by identifying the \\nmost urgent issue first, then running through in your mind the other \\nissues to be considered. For each issue keep thinking: What are the facts \\n(symptoms, signs, and test results)? What do I imagine is going on (the \\ndiagnoses)? What should I do (tests, treatments, and advice)? When you \\nwrite down an account later, do so in response to the same questions. \\nWithin each of these questions, consider what is happening in each system. \\nYou can do this using sieves.

Despite all of this, it is still possible that there could  \\nbe agranulocytosis due to carbimazole sensitivity. However, the raised \\nleukocyte count with 90% neutrophils excludes this diagnosis because a \\nlow or absent WBC is obviously a necessary condition for the diagnosis \\nof agranulocytosis. There is no need, therefore, to stop the carbimazole \\nimmediately. \\nThe glycosuria and random blood sugar of 151 mg/dL makes the diagno-\\nsis of diabetes mellitus (DM) probable. If the patient has no symptoms o f \\ndiabetes and an active intercurrent illness (as in this case), two fasting \\nsugars >126 mg/dL would be needed to satisfy the World Health Organi-\\nzation (WHO) criteria so that the diagnosis would be acceptable to other \\ndoctors. \\nLook at the other positive findings and consider if they would all  \\nresolve if the acute follicular tonsillitis resolved. Use common sense, \\nexperience, and imagination from your knowledge of physiology. The \\nonly remaining problems would be the glycosuria, prior thyrotoxicosis, \\nand the patient living alone when very ill.  \\nThe main working diagnosis  therefore is \\n- Acute follicular tonsillitis \\nThe other diagnoses are \\n- Probable type II diabetes mellitus \\n- Controlled thyrotoxicosis \\n- Inadequate home care \\nThe plan is \\n- Start \\n- Penicillin V 500 mg four times a day (qid) \\n- Acetaminophen 650 mg qid \\n- Continue  \\n- Carbimazole 5 mg once a day (qd) \\n- Help patient to contact family \\n '),\n",

Diseases of the \\nnerve (e.g., polyneuropathy), muscle (e.g., myopathy), and neuromuscular \\njunction (e.g., myasthenia gravis) may present with varying degrees of \\nsensory loss and weakness. Nevertheless, specific patterns of sensory and \\nmotor disturbances help differentiate between disorders. \\nWeakness can arise from dysfunction of nerve, neuromuscular junc-\\ntion, or muscle, and may be a difficult symptom for patients to quantify  \\nand localize. Frequently, patients will complain of pain and associated \\nweakness. However, since pain may limit the action and mobility of a \\njoint, the finding of weakness in the setting of pain may not indicat e true \\nneurological dysfunction. \\nIt is important to distinguish myalgias (muscle pain) from arthralgias \\n(joint pain). Additionally, many musculoskeletal symptoms are part of a \\nsystemic illness, so constitutional symptoms are always important to \\nelicit. \\nFor muscular complaints, the pattern of symptoms is important to  \\nascertain: which muscle groups are involved (localized to one extremity, \\nproximal vs. distal, etc.) and whether there is accompanying weakness. \\nFamily history may give you a clue (e.g., inherited muscle storage diseases \\nor a family history of autoimmune disease).

A careful history and physical examination will \\nhelp in determining the distinction between asthenia (motor impairment \\ndue to pain or joint dysfunction) and true weakness. \\nPatients with a variety of systemic disorders (cardiopulmonary and \\njoint disease, anemia, cachexia, depression) may interpret difficulties in \\nperforming certain tasks as weakness. These patients may be functionally \\nlimited but not truly weak. True weakness due to a decrease in muscle \\npower must be differentiated from limitation due to dyspnea, chest pain, \\njoint pain, fatigue, poor exercise tolerance, paresthesias, or spasticity. \\nMuscle complaints should be further characterized by the muscle groups \\ninvolved, exacerbation with exercise, and the presence of fasciculations. \\nMuscle pain is relatively uncommon in patients with many types of \\nmyopathy and true weakness, but is often a problem for patients with \\noverexertion, cramps, or fibromyalgia.  \\nThe physical examination should include not only testing of muscle \\nstrength but also a careful search for one of the disorders that can cause \\nthe perception of weakness.  \\nSome differential diagnoses and typical outline evidence \\n \\nPrimary muscle disorders  \\nNormal  \\nresponse to  \\nstrenuous  \\nexercise Suggested by: fit, healthy, unaccustomed exercise \\n1–2 days before \\nConfirmed by:  spontaneous resolution  \\nPrimary  \\nthyroid disease— \\nboth hyper- and \\nhypothryodism  Suggested by: onset over weeks to months. \\nPredominant fatigue.

Use optimal viewing conditions, preferably recessed lighting to avoid \\nmonitor glare. \\n 2. Check the patient’s name, gender, age, and medical record number to \\nensure correct identity.  \\n 3. Check if the film is labeled PA (X-rays passing from posterior to \\nanterior in a standard way) or AP (X-rays passing from anterior to \\nposterior). AP views are commonly performed when the patient is ill, \\nusing a portable X-ray tube. These views will often be semi-erect \\nfilms with suboptimal exposure factors. X-rays passing through the \\nbody from anterior to posterior magnify the mediastinum; therefore \\nAP films should not be used to assess cardiac size or hilar configuration. \\n 4. Check which sides are labeled left and right and whether the cardiac \\napex is on the left (if not, the patient may have dextrocardia). \\n 5. Check the patient’s positioning. Are the sternoclavicular joints equi-\\ndistant from the spinous processes of the vertebral column? If not, \\nthen the patient was rotated. Rotation causes asymmetry of shoulder \\ngirdle muscles projected over the lung fields. Consequently, the side \\nthat has the less space between the end of the clavicle and spinous \\nprocess has more muscle projected over the lung fields and is whiter \\nthan the other side. Be cautious in the interpretation of a rotated \\nchest radiograph. \\n 6. Check to see if the vertebral column is visible through the heart \\nshadow. If not, then it is “under-penetrated” (the X-ray beam was \\ntoo weak); normal lung tissue will look abnormally opaque (white). \\n 7. Check to see if the lung fields appear dark. If they are, and the verte-\\nbral column can be seen very clearly, and the heart shadow is vague, \\nthe film is “over-penetrated,” and abnormalities may be missed. \\n 8. Check to ensure the diaphragm is between the fifth and sixth anterior \\nrib ends. If it is higher, then the patient did not take a deep breath, \\nand interpretation of the appearance of the lungs and mediastinum \\nwill be suboptimal. If the diaphragmatic domes are flattened, then \\nemphysematous changes are likely. \\n 9. After addressing the basic technical issues, are there objects in the  \\nX-ray that strike you immediately? Check for foreign bodies, e.g.,  \\nendotracheal tubes, catheters, chest drains, etc. A striking radio-\\nopaque (white) or lucent (dark) area is likely to be a good lead.  \\n10. Assess the X-ray systematically for subtle abnormalities by: \\na. initially looking at the film without considering the clinical scenario. \\nThere is often a tendency to miss obvious things that do not fit \\nwith the differential diagnosis. Afterwards, review the X-ray again \\nwith the clinical information in mind. \\nb. looking at each lung separately, starting at the base and progressing \\nto the apex, carefully looking for abnormalities. Compare the left \\nto the right lung by starting at the lung bases and progressing to \\nthe apices, scanning from the lateral border or the right lung to the  \\nlateral border of the left lung and back to the opposite side and  \\nrepeating until the apices are reached. Look “behind” the heart  \\nand below the diaphragm. '),\n",

Introduction  \\n1.1 What are Respiratory Diseases?  \\n• Respiratory diseases are illnesses that affect the organs and tissues in the lungs and \\nairway systems, making gas exchange and breathing difficult.  \\n• The airway systems start from the nose, lead to the large and small wind pipes and \\nreach the lungs.

Last updated by Toxipedia in 201 1. \\nDr. Steve Gilbert, author.  \\n \\nIntroduction  \\nCancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells that have damaged DNA expression. The cancerous cells \\nrepeatedly divide, displacing normal tissue. The cancer or neoplasm may be either benign or malignant: \\na benign cancer stays confined to the tissue of origin, while malignant cancer can spread to other \\norgans. The secondary growths or metastases are a serious complication to any treatment of the \\ncancerous cells. A  tumor is any space -filling group of cells that may or may not be cancerous.  \\nBenign growths or tumors are usually noted by adding the ending \" -oma.\" For example, adenoma would \\nbe a benign growth of the adrenal cortex, a hormone -producing group of cells nea r the kidney. \\nMalignant tumors are noted by adding \"sarcoma\" or \"carcinoma\". A malignance of the adrenal cortex \\nwould be an adenocarcinoma. Bone cancer would be osteosarcoma.  \\n \\nToxicology informs us about cancer on two accounts. First, toxicology research p rovided insight into the \\ncauses of cancer and likelihood of developing cancer. Second, many cancer treatments have serious \\ntoxicological side effects. Cancer treatment must often balance the need to kill the cancerous cells and \\nthe need to protect healthy cells.  \\n \\nCancer - A Short History  \\nThe oldest descriptions of cancer date back to Egypt, at about 1600 BC. The so -called  Edwin Smith \\nPapyrus  describes eight cases of what appears to be breast cancer. The tumors \\nof the breast were treated by cauterization, w ith a tool called \"the fire drill.\"  \\nThe first occupational association with cancer was noted in 1700 with the \\nobservation that nuns had an elevated incidence of breast cancer. In 1775, the \\nEnglish physician and surgeon  Percivall Pott  made the observation t hat exposure \\nto soot might explain the high incidence of scrotum cancer in chimney sweeps. \\nThis was the first indication that exposure to chemicals, in this case a complex \\nmixture, could cause cancer. However, this new knowledge did not immediately \\ntransla te into improved working conditions for chimney sweeps. Over 100 years \\nlater it was observed that cancer of the scrotum was rare in continental Europe \\nbut still high in England, possibly due to better hygiene practices in Europe. We \\nstill have not taken to  heart the cancerous consequences of exposure to smoke \\nand tar, as ongoing consumption of tobacco products clearly shows.

The first indication came from increases in skin \\nand bladder cancers associated with cutting oils and dyes. In 1895, bladder cancer was associated with \\nworkers in the  aniline  dye industry. Further worker -based studies found that exposure to specific \\nchemicals could be responsible for the cancer. In 1915, Japanese researchers reported that they could \\ninduce skin tumors in animals by repeatedly applying a coal tar solution to the skin of rabbits. Thes e \\nearly studies, subsequently repeated with mice, ushered in the scientific investigation of the chemical \\ncauses of cancer. These studies also initiated the systematic investigation of the adverse health effects \\nof chemicals, which in many ways laid the fo undation for the toxicological sciences.  \\n \\nBut chemicals are not the only cause of cancer.  Marie Curie, awarded Nobel Prizes in both physics and \\nchemistry, discovered  radium  in 1898. The green glow of radium fascinated \\npeople, and many thought it was a cur e for many diseases, including cancer. \\nThe carcinogenicity of radium became tragically apparent whenyoung women \\ndeveloped bone cancer from painting watch dials with radium.The use \\nof nuclear  weapons by the U.S. military in World War II, and subsequent \\ndeve lopment of the defense and nuclear industries in various countries, have \\nraised public awareness of the health consequences of  radiationexposure. \\nNaturally occurring background radiation, as well as our many medical and \\nindustrial exposures to radiation, i s responsible for some cancers. (Photo: \\nMarie Curie in 1911.)  \\n \\nMore recent research has broadened our understanding of cancer's causes. Epidemiology studies of \\nvarious human populations indicated that inorganic  metals  such as  arsenic  and nickel could cause  \\ncancer; this was subsequently confirmed in animal studies. Various hormones are implicated in organ -\\nspecific cancer, such as breast cancer. Nutrition and diet also appear to be related to cancer, specifically \\nhigh caloric intake. The grain contaminant afl atoxin B1 is known to cause liver cancer.  \\nChemical mixtures or exposure to multiple agents can increase the incidence of cancer; for example,  \\nsmoking  and asbestos  exposure increase the likelihood of lung cancer. And finally, we are now learning \\nthat our genetic makeup increases the likelihood that certain cancers will develop. For example, breast \\ncancer is linked to specific genes.   \\n \\nSelected History of Cancer  \\nYear  Cancer Type   Cause   \\n1775  Scrotal Cancer  Soot  \\n1822  Skin Cancer  Arsenic  \\n1879  Lung Cancer  Uranium  Mining  \\n1895  Bladder Cancer  Aniline  Dyes  \\n1902  Skin Cancer  X-rays \\n\"),\n",

This was the first linking of occupational chemical \\nexposure to cancer. Unfortunately this understanding was not t ranslated into action and prevention. By \\nthe late 1890s, scrotal cancer was relatively rare on the European content but still high in England, \\nwhich some suggested was due to poor hygiene: failure to remove the soot from the skin resulted in \\nchronic exposu re to the chemicals in soot, which resulted in cancer. This example recalls the most basic \\ntenets of public health: wash your hands (or other body parts).  \\n \\nScientific investigation of the cancer -causing properties of soot took a step forward when Japanese \\nresearch found that skin tumors developed if coal tar was repeatedly applied to the skin of rabbits. In \\nthe 1930s  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  were isolated from coal tar and demonstrated to be \\ncarcinogenic. Despite this evidence, millions of people co ntinue to expose themselves to the soot from \\ntobacco and suffer from the resulting lung cancer.  \\n \\nBenzene  \\nBenzene, C6H6, is a clear, colorless liquid at room temperature that readily evaporates. It is derived \\nfrom petroleum and is widely used in the product ion of other products such as rubber, nylon, synthetic \\nfiber, lubricants, glues, detergents, dyes,  drugs, and  pesticides, to name just a few. \\nWorldwide,benzene  use and production are measured in the billions of pounds, making it one of the top \\ntwenty chemi cals in use. In the United States, benzene is present in gasoline at about 2%, but in other \\ncountries the amount may be up to 5%.  \\n \\nBenzene  is classified as a human carcinogen. Liver enzymes convert benzene to more toxic metabolites; \\nthis mechanism is thoug ht to be what causes its carcinogenicity. Benzene is readily absorbed by \\ninhalation, and acute exposure can result in central nervous system effects such as dizziness, \\ndrowsiness, and eventual unconsciousness. Chronic exposure to benzene affects the bone m arrow by \\ncrippling blood cell production, causing anemia, which can ultimately result in leukemia.  \\nAt one time benzene was widely used as a  solvent, resulting in excessive worker exposure; it continues \\nto be a significant workplace contaminant. Benzene is present in the indoor environment from off  \\ngassing of glues, synthetic materials, and  tobacco  smoke. Smokers can have benzene body burdens ten \\ntimes that of nonsmokers. Because of its widespread use in industry, benzene is a common contaminant \\nof hazardous  waste and old industrial sites. The  US EPA  recommends the benzene not exceed 5 ppb '),\n",

The  US Occupational Health and Safety \\nAdministration  set a standard of 1 ppm of benzene in the air over an 8 -hour perio d with an action level \\nset at 0.5 ppm in an effort to encourage reductions in the workplace environment. Other agencies have \\nestablished even lower standards down to 0.1 ppm benzene in the air.  \\n \\nAsbestos  \\nAsbestos, a recognized human carcinogen, has a long and curious history. Asbestos continues to cause \\nserious human health effects and continues to be the subject of legal action against companies that \\nused or produced it.  \\n \\nAsbestos is the common name given to a group of six different naturally occurring fib rous minerals that \\ncan be separated into long fibers that can be spun and woven. The material is strong, flexible, resistant \\nto heat and most solvents and acids, making it a very useful industrial product. Knowledge of asbestos \\ngoes back to the 2nd century  B.C., but the first recorded use of the word asbestos was in the 1st century \\nA.D. by Pliny the Elder.  \\n \\nThe fire -resistant properties of  asbestos  were recognized early and contributed to its derivation from \\nthe Greek  sbestos  or \"extinguishable,\" thus a -sbestos or inextinguishable. The Romans used asbestos to \\nmake cremation cloths and lamp wicks and in the Middle Ages, knights used asbestos to insulate their \\nsuits of armor. The use of asbestos increased with the Industrial Revolution and the need for a mater ial \\nto insulate steam boilers, such as those in locomotives. The first asbestos mine opened in 1879 in \\nQuebec, Canada. Canada continues to be the world\\'s largest producer of asbestos, followed by Russia, \\nChina, Brazil and several other countries. In the Un ited States, California produces a small amount but \\nthe majority of the asbestos used in the United States is imported from Canada.  \\n \\nSerious lung disease associated with asbestos inhalation was first described in the early 1900s in \\nEngland. This disease be came known as asbestosis and was fully described in British medical journals in \\n1924 as young workers died from asbestos exposure. By the early 1930s, dose -related injury, length of \\ntime exposed, and the latency of response were being well characterized in  both Europe and the United \\nStates. By the mid and late 1930s the first associations with lung cancer were documented. In the 1960s \\nthe consequences of asbestos exposure for many workers in World War II started to become evident. \\nMesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung, was found to be almost exclusively associated with \\nasbestos exposure.  \\n \\nIn the United States, regulation of asbestos exposure started in the early 1970s, with exposure limits \\nrapidly decreasing as the serious and latent consequences of asbestos exposure became apparent. \\nWhite asbestos or chrysotile was used in thousands of consumer products and is common in many older \\nhomes. The serious health effects of asbestos exposure have resulted in both regulatory and legal \\naction, and many cou ntries have instituted complete bans on asbestos use.  \\n \\nRadon  \\nRadon is another example of a very curious and toxic compound that many of us regularly inhale, one \\nhopes in small amounts. For those regularly exposed to radon, there is an increased risk for lu ng cancer \\nand for those who smoke, radon exposure results in a three -fold increase in the incidence of lung '),\n",

In the United States it is estimated that indoor radon exposure causes between 7,000 and \\n30,000 lung cancer related deaths each year, second  only to tobacco smoking.  \\n \\nRadon -222 is a colorless and odorless  radioactive  gas that results from the decay of Radium -226, which \\nis widely distributed in the earth's crust. Radon decays with a half -life of 3.8 days into solid particles of  \\npolonium. It is actually the breakdown of polonium that causes cancer: polonium sticks to the tissues of \\nthe lung, and when it decays it releases an alpha particle, which damages the DNA of the closest cell.  \\n \\nLung diseases, possibly related to radon, were first reported i n the 1400s, and in 1879 lung cancer was \\nseen in European miners. Radon was discovered several years later in 1900 by the German chemist \\nFriedrich Ernst Dorn. Regulation of workplace exposure began in the 1950s and subsequent studies of \\nunderground mine wo rkers in Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, Australia, Sweden and the United States \\nhave allowed researchers to develop very sophisticated models of the cancer -causing effects of radon.  \\nIt is difficult to translate these results into the effects of radon on i ndoor home exposure. The United \\nStates EPA sets an action level of four picocuries per liter (pCi/l). There are some areas of the United \\nStates and Europe with high levels of radon that can enter homes, schools or public buildings, \\nparticularly underground  levels. In the United States, it is estimated that 1 in 15 (6%) of homes have \\nelevated levels of radon. A number of public and private organizations provide information on reducing \\nindoor radon exposure.   \\n \\nSee the  References and Additional Information  page for links to information on benzene, asbestos, and \\nradon.  \\n \\nGenetic Toxicology and the Biology of Cancer  \\nGenetic toxicology is the study of the effects of chemical and physical agents on genetic material. It \\nincludes the study of DNA damage in living c ells that leads to cancer, but it also examines changes in \\nDNA that can be inherited from one generation to the next. Genetic toxicology, although not called that \\nat the time, got its start in 1927 when American geneticist  Hermann J. Muller  (1890 -1967) dem onstrated \\nthat X-rays increased the rate of gene mutations and chromosome changes in fruit flies.  \\n \\nThe relevance of genetic toxicology is clearly evident from inheritable diseases such as phenylketonuria \\n(an inability to metabolize phenylalanine), cystic f ibrosis (lung disease), sickle cell anemia, and Tay -Sachs \\ndisease. Recent advances in molecular biology and genomic sciences are leading to a far greater \\nunderstanding of the genetic cause of disease and even pointing the way to treatments.  \\n \\nDNA Mutations  \\nTo understand cancer it is necessary to explore the cellular changes that turn a normal cell into a \\nmalignant cell that repeatedly and uncontrollably divides. This transformation occurs when there is \\ngenetic damage or an alteration in the structure of a ce ll's DNA.  \\n \\nDNA, short for deoxyribonucleic acid, is the coding machinery of life. The beauty of DNA is its simplicity. \\nThe double helix of DNA is made of the compounds adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine \\n(C). These chemicals are bound in long stretches as AT and CG pairs, and wrapped in sugar molecules \"),\n",

Long stretches of these AT and CG combinations form genes which when \\n\"read\" produce the proteins that drive our cells.  \\n \\nIdeally the DNA sequence would not change exc ept in the recombining that occurs during reproduction. \\nHowever, DNA damage occurs regularly as part of the cell process, and from interaction with both \\nnormal cellular chemicals and with toxic chemicals. A very robust repair mechanism rapidly and very \\naccurately repairs the DNA damage, but if for some reason the DNA is repaired incorrectly, a mutation \\noccurs. The mutation is a subtle or not -so-subtle change in the A, G, C, or T that make up the DNA.  \\n \\nMany of the mutations have no effect, some have minor ef fects, and a small number have life -\\nthreatening effects. If a mutation occurs in the wrong place, a cell can start to divide uncontrollably, \\nbecoming a malignant cell and causing a cancer. If a mutation occurs in our germ line cells, the mutation \\ncan be pa ssed on to our offspring.  \\n \\nMutagens  \\nChemicals that induce mutations in the DNA are called mutagens, and when these changes lead to \\ncancer the chemical is called a carcinogen. Not all mutagens are carcinogens, and not all carcinogens are \\nmutagens. In 1946 i t was shown that nitrogen mustards (derived from mustard gas first used by the \\nmilitary in 1917 during WWI) could induce mutations in the fruit fly and reduce tumor growth in mice. \\nGenetic toxicology developed ways to test chemical and physical agents for their mutagenic properties, \\nand in the 1970s, Bruce Ames and others developed a cellular -based test for genetic mutations. This test \\nbecame known as the Ames assay. Sophisticated variations of these tests are now required by many \\ngovernment regulatory agen cies to test chemicals for mutagenicity before they are of approved for use.  \\nOften it is a metabolite (breakdown product) of the compound that causes cancer, not the original \\ncompound. Ideally, a foreign chemical is made less toxic when metabolized, but so metimes a chemical \\ncan be made more toxic. This more -toxic chemical can then interact with cellular DNA or proteins and \\nproduce malignant cells. This process is called bioactivation. It is also possible for a chemical to \\nencourage bioactivation or to accel erate the development of a cancer. Many variations of the Ames test \\nthat include liver cells were developed to simulate the metabolism of the chemical in the liver and \\ndetermine if bioactivation would result in mutations.   \\nEfforts to understand the underly ing biology of cancer are ongoing. The genomic sciences are helping to \\nexplain why some people are more susceptible to cancer than others. We also know that there are many \\ncauses of cancer and that we can reduce the likelihood of developing cancer.   \\n \\nWhat Causes Cancer?  \\nWe are continuously exposed to a wide range of chemical and physical agents, both natural and human -\\ngenerated, that may cause cancer. Exposure to sunlight, background radiation, natural and \\nmanufactured chemicals, even oxygen can damage our DNA and result in cancer.  \\nBecause our knowledge is imperfect, there is a great deal of conflicting information on the causes of \\ncancer and what can be done to reduce the risk of developing cancer. And we are just beginning to \\nunderstand how our individual genetic makeup influences the possibility of developing cancer and other \\ngenetic -based disease.  \\n '),\n",

Tobacco  consumption probably accounts for between \\n25 to 40% of all cancer deaths. The other major lifestyle choices associated with cancer \\nare alcoholconsumption and diet. Alcohol increases the incidence of liver disease and liver cancer. Diet \\nhas a broad range of effects, some good and some not so good. Some cooked meats have a higher \\nconcentrations of agents that appear to cause cancer; howeve r, a diet rich in vegetables may reduce the \\nincidence of cancer. High caloric intake and high fat consumption may encourage the onset of cancer \\nfrom other agents.  \\n \\nNumerous organic chemicals are known or likely carcinogens. In the 1930s, benzo(a)pyrene was  isolated \\nfrom coal tar and shown to cause skin cancer. Further investigation revealed an entire class of \\ncarcinogenic compounds called  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Shortly after World War II, it \\nwas discovered that azo dyes could also cause ca ncer. In the 1960s, naturally occurring contaminants \\nfrom a grain fungus (aflatoxin) were found to be a potent liver carcinogen.  \\n \\nInorganic chemicals and fibers are also carcinogenic.  Arsenic  is the most serious human carcinogen \\nbecause of exposure from drinking water.  Cadmium, chromium, and nickel are all lung carcinogens. The \\nmost common lung carcinogen is  asbestos, which has unique properties making it ideal for many \\nindustrial and even home insulation applications. It was also used in shipyards and in  car brake pads. \\nThis widespread use resulted in thousands of workers being exposed to asbestos and suffering from a \\nrange of lung diseases, including cancer. Asbestos exposure produces a very unique form of lung cancer \\ncalled mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is  caused in part by asbestos fibers inducing a chronic irritation of \\nthe lung, resulting in an inflammatory response that ultimately causes some cells to become cancerous.  \\nHormones, which regulate many important bodily functions, are also associated with ca ncer. One of the \\nfirst hints of the relationship between hormones and cancers was the observation that nuns had a '),\n",

Since that time there \\nhave been numerous studies on the asso ciation of  birth control, childbirth, and most recently, hormone \\nreplacement, with cancer. In males there is ongoing study of hormones and prostate cancer. While it is \\nclear that hormones and cancer are related, the exact characterization of this relations hip is still unclear.  \\n \\nWe are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of diet and nutrition in reducing the risk of \\ncancer. From a toxicological perspective, it is important to reduce exposure to agents that increase the \\nrisk of cancer. Cancer, like declining physical and mental ability, is related to old age and may even be a \\nnatural consequence of the aging process. However, exposure to cancer -causing agents increases the \\nrisk or likelihood of developing cancer.  \\nCancer - Regulatory Standards  \\nNationa l and international agencies have established systems to classify agents according to the \\nlikelihood that the agent may cause cancer. This is often a difficult process because the information on \\nan agent may be incomplete or inconclusive. Data from any hum an epidemiology studies are evaluated \\nfirst, followed by information from animal studies. The  International Agency for Research on \\nCancer(IARC) has developed one of the most comprehensive classification schemes. In this scheme an \\nagent is rated from 1 to 4  based on human and animal data (see table below). Other classification \\nschemes are in use by the  U.S. EPA,  National Toxicology Program,  National Institute of Occupational \\nHealth Sciences (NIOSH), and the State of California.   \\n \\nIARC Classification Scheme f or Carcinogenicity of Chemical and Physical Agents  \\nGroup  Evidence  Example  \\n1.

Cancer can start almost anywhere in the body.  \\nNormally, our cells grow and divide to form new cells as our body needs them. When cells  grow old or become \\ndamaged, they die, and new cells take their place. When cancer develops, however, this orderly process breaks down. Cells become more and more abnormal. Old or damaged cells survive when they should die, and new cells form when \\nthey are  not needed. These extra cells can form growths called tumours.  \\nCancerous tumours are malignant, which means they can invade nearby tissues. In addition, as these tumours grow, \\nsome cancer cells can break off and travel to distant places in the body throug h the blood or the lymph system and \\nform new tumours far from the original.  \\nSolid tumours are masses of tissue named for the type of cells they formed from. Liquid tumours, such as leukemias, \\nare cancers of the blood and bone marrow.  \\nUnlike malignant tumours, benign tumours do not spread into nearby tissues and often don’t grow back when they are \\nremoved. Benign tumours can sometimes be quite large and, in the case of benign brain tumours, can be life \\nthreatening.  \\n \\n1Adapted from: https://www.cancer.gov/about -cancer/understanding/what -is-cancer    '),\n",

For instance, cancer cells can induce nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply \\ntumours with oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products.  \\n• Cancer cells often evade or hide from the immune system that would norma lly remove them. They can even \\nco-opt the immune system to help them grow and stay alive.  \\nHow Cancer Arises  \\nCancer is a genetic disease —that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially \\nhow they grow and divide.  \\nCancer:  \\n• can be inherited \\n• can arise because of errors that occur as cells divide  \\n• can be caused when DNA is damaged by exposure to environmental factors including chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet radiation from the sun.  \\n• can be caused by epigenetic  alterations, which affect the behaviour of genes without affecting the genetic \\nstructure itself. Epigenetic \"marks\" switch genes on or off in response to diet, stress, prenatal nutrition and a \\nwide range of other environmental influences. Some epigenetic changes can be passed from one generation to \\nthe next.  \\nEach person’s cancer involves a unique combination of genetic changes. As a cancer continues to grow, additional changes occur. A single tumour may contain many different genetic variations. In general , cancer cells exhibit more \\ngenetic changes than normal cells. Some changes may be the result of the cancer rather than its cause.  \\n\"Drivers\" of Cancer  \\nThe genetic origins of cancer tend to arise in two main types of genes —oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. \\nThese mutations are sometimes called “drivers” of cancer.  \\nAltered oncogenes stop regulating cell division, allowing cells to grow and survive when they should not. Tumour suppressor genes, which would normally stop cancer, are altered and enable cells to divide uncontrollably.  \\nWhen Cancer Spreads  \\nIn metastasis, c ancer cells break away from where they first formed (primary cancer), travel through the blood or lymph \\nsystem, and form new tumours (metastatic tumours) in other parts of the body.

For this \\nreason, the original and metastatic tumours are considered the same type of cancer. For instance, breast cancer that \\nmetastasizes in the lung is metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer.  \\nMetastatic tumours can severely damage how the body functions. Most people who die of cancer die of metastatic disease. Most treatments for metastatic cancers are designed to relieve symptoms and control the size of tumours and their further spread. But reducing cancer deaths requires curing metastatic disease outright.  \\nTissue Changes that Are Not Cancer  \\nNot every change in the body’s tissues is cancer, though many may develop into cancer if they are not treated. The diagram on the next page shows the progression of cellular changes that may lead to cancer.  \\nHyperplasia occurs when cells within a tissue divide faster than normal and build up or proliferate. The cells and the \\nway the tissue is organized look normal under a microscope. Hyperplasi a can be caused by chronic irritation or several \\nother factors.  \\nDysplasia is more serious than hyperplasia. Dysplasia also involves a buildup of extra cells, but the cells look abnormal and there are changes in how the tissue is organized. In general, the more abnormal the cells and tissue look, the \\ngreater the chance that cancer will form. \\nSome types of dysplasia may need to be monitored or treated. For example, an abnormal skin mole called a dysplastic \\nmay turn into melanoma.  \\nAn even more serious condition is carcinoma in situ . Carcinoma in situ is not invasive cancer because the abnormal \\ncells do not spread beyond the original tissue. But, because some carcinomas in situ become invasive, they are usually treated.  \\n \\nCancer Progression  \\nSource: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Cancer_progression_from_NIH.png  \\n \\n'),\n",

Cancers are usually named for the organs or tissues where they form. For \\nexample, lung cancer starts in lung cells, and brain cancer in brain cells. Cancers also may be described by the type of \\ncell that formed them, such as an epithelial cell or a squamous cell.  \\nCarcinomas  are the most common type of cancer. They are formed by epithelial cells, which are the cells that cover the \\ninside and outside surfaces of the body. There are many types of epithelial cells, which often have a column -like shape \\nwhen viewed under a m icroscope. Carcinomas that begin in different epithelial cell types have specific names:  \\n• Adenocarcinoma forms in epithelial cells that produce fluids or mucus. Tissues with this type of epithelial cell \\nare sometimes called glandular tissues. Most cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate are adenocarcinomas.  \\n• Basal cell carcinoma begins in the lower or basal (base) layer of the epidermis, or outer layer of skin.  \\n• Squamous cell carcinoma forms in squamous cells, which grow just beneath the outer surface of t he skin. They \\nalso line many other organs, including the stomach, intestines, lungs, bladder, and kidneys. Under a \\nmicroscope, Squamous cells look flat, like fish scales. Squamous cell carcinomas are sometimes called \\nepidermoid carcinomas.  \\n• Transitional cel l carcinoma forms in a type of epithelial tissue called transitional epithelium, or urothelium. This \\ntissue, made up of many layers of epithelial cells, lines the bladder, ureters, a part of the kidneys called the \\nrenal pelvis, and other organs. Some cancers of the bladder, ureters, and kidneys are transitional cell \\ncarcinomas.  \\nSarcomas are cancers that form in bone and soft tissues, including muscle, fat, blood vessels, lymph vessels, and \\nfibrous tissue (such as tendons and ligaments). Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer. Common soft -tissue \\nsarcomas include leiomyosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma, and \\ndermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.  \\nLeukemias  are cancers that begin in the blood -forming tissue of the bone marrow ( also called liquid tumours). Large \\nnumbers of abnormal white blood cells (leukemia cells and leukemic blast cells) build up in the blood and bone \\nmarrow, crowding out normal blood cells, and making it harder for the body to deliver oxygen, control bleeding, and \\nfight infections.  \\nThe four common categories of leukemia are based on how quickly they progress (acute or chronic) and the type of \\nblood cell they start in (lymphoblastic or myeloid).  \\nLymphoma  begins in lymphocytes (T cells or B cells). These diseas e-fighting white blood cells are part of the immune \\nsystem. With lymphoma, abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes and vessels, as well as in other organs. There are two main types of lymphoma:  \\n• Hodgkin lymphoma: People with this disease have abnormal lymphocytes called Reed- Sternberg cells. These \\ncells usually form from B cells.  \\n \\n2Adapted from: https://www.cancer.gov/about -cancer/understanding/what -is-cancer    '),\n",

Abnormal plasma \\ncells called myeloma cells build up in the bone marrow and form tumours in bones all through the body. Multiple \\nmyeloma is also called plasma -cell myeloma or K ahler disease.  \\nMelanoma  begins in cells that become melanocytes, which make melanin (the pigment that gives skin its color). Most \\nmelanomas form on the skin, but they can also form in other pigmented tissues, such as the eye (intraocular \\nmelanoma). \\nBrain a nd spinal cord tumours  have different types. These tumours are named for the type of cell in which they form \\nand for the place where the tumour first forms. For example, an astrocytic tumour begins in star -shaped brain cells \\ncalled astrocytes, which help k eep nerve cells healthy. Brain tumours can be benign (not cancerous) or malignant \\n(cancerous). But because of the confined space of the skull, even benign brain tumours can be life- threatening.  \\nGerm -cell tumours  are a type of tumour that begins in the cells that give rise to sperm or eggs. These tumours can \\noccur almost anywhere in the body and can be either benign or malignant.  \\nNeuroendocrine tumours  form from cells that release hormones into the blood in response to a signal from the \\nnervous system. These  tumours, which may make higher -than- normal amounts of hormones, can cause many different \\nsymptoms. Neuroendocrine tumours may be benign or malignant.  \\nCarcinoid tumours  are a type of neuroendocrine tumour. They are slow -growing tumours in the gastrointesti nal system \\n(most often in the rectum and small intestine). Carcinoid tumours may spread to the liver or other sites in the body, and may secrete substances such as serotonin or prostaglandins, causing carcinoid syndrome.  \\n \\nMoving Away from Anatomically -base d Cancer Classifications \\nOn May 9, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) published an official reclassification of Tumour Types of the Central Ner vous \\nSystem, which integrates molecular information with histology so that cancers can be more accurately diagnosed and treated.  \\nSince the advent of new technology and capabilities for genomic sequencing, molecular studies on brain tumours have revealed the \\nvast diversity of genetic and epigenetic alterations that exist between brain tumours. This biological heterogeneity often means \\ntumours that may, at first blush, appear to be the same, may require a different approach to treatment –  as well as the converse (i.e., \\ntumours that may look different under the microscope may have common molecular alterations). Further studies have also shown \\nthat molecular signatures in tumour cells can define different groups of brain tumour types with distinctive characteristics,  and that \\nanalyzing a tumour for mutations or deletions in certain genes or regions of chromosomes, c an provide a deeper level of \\nunderstanding of each tumour’s make -up. \\nThus, it was critical that molecular data be integrated into traditional histopathology approaches to reclassify brain tumour  types \\nmore effectively. This moves the brain tumour field further into the era of precision medicine.  \\nAbstracted from: http://braintumor.org/brain- tumor- information/understanding -brain- tumors/tumor -types/#acoustic- neuroma   '),\n",

       " 'C HA PT ER 1 The diagnostic process 4 Problem solving skills Information processing is a primary goal of the physician patient interaction It proceeds in three phases data processing hypothesis generation and creation of a differential diagnosis The division between these phases is somewhat artificial but it is practical Data processing Immediately after the patient encounter and possibly after reviewing some basic labs and radiographic studies an accounting of all positive and negative findings takes place During this phase the clinician undertakes the process of collecting and examining all the findings or data and analyzing them to look for a common relationship between them By trying to fit these findings together to make a more accurate hypothesis the top or most likely diagnoses will emerge from this process Toward that end a positive finding is an abnormal finding in the patient a negative finding is either a normal finding that was expected to be abnormal or the absence of a positive finding that was expected to be present During early attempts at this type of data analysis we suggest that you create a table to help you master this process First make a list of all positive and negative findings This step involves the following Listing all positive and negative symptoms Listing all positive and negative physical findings Listing all positive and negative laboratory findings For example a positive finding in a patient with chest pain is that the pain is closely associated with exertion and relieved with rest A negative finding in such a patient would be the absence of relief of the pain with nitroglycerin because one would expect such a response with chest pain from coronary artery disease Data processing is also the first step in generation of a problem list Also consider each of the following attributes of findings Assessment of relevance to the chief complaint Each finding is exam ined for its relevance by classifying it as definitely relevant possibly relevant or irrelevant separate problem Assessment of reliability certainty of each finding It is normal for findings to be equivocal Inexperienced clinicians will have many more equivocal findings than will seasoned clinicians simply because of their lack of experience However not all equivocal findings pertain to experience of the clinician For example a heart murmur may be equivocal to the most talented cardiologist simply because that is the nature of the human body The important thing is to acknowledge equivocal findings when they occur Hypothesis generation This process begins during the patient encounter often within the first few minutes after the interaction has started While the clinician is still recording factual information either in written notes or in memory various pieces of information rise to the surface',\n",

       " '2 P IP Digest Differences between Cancer Cells and Norma l Cells Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways that allow them to grow out of control and become invasive Unlike normal cells that mature into very distinct types with specific functions cancer cells are less specialized which helps them di vide without stopping Cancer cells ignore signals that would otherwise stop them dividing or that begin the process known as programmed cell death or apoptosis Cancer cells influence surrounding normal cells molecules and blood vessels an area known as the microenvironment For instance cancer cells can induce nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply tumours with oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products Cancer cells often evade or hide from the immune system that would norma lly remove them They can even co opt the immune system to help them grow and stay alive How Cancer Arises Cancer is a genetic disease that is it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function especially how they grow and divide Cancer can be inherited can arise because of errors that occur as cells divide can be caused when D NA is damaged by exposure to environmental factors including chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet radiation from the sun can be caused by epigenetic alterations which affect the behaviour of genes without affecting the genetic structure itself Epigenetic marks switch genes on or off in response to diet stress prenatal nutrition and a wide range of other environmental influences Some epigenetic changes can be passed from one generation to the next Each person s cancer involves a unique combination of genetic changes As a cancer continues to grow additional changes occur A single tumour may contain many different genetic variations In general cancer cells exhibit more genetic changes than normal cells Some changes may be the result of the cancer rather than its cause Drivers of Cancer The genetic origins of cancer tend to arise in two main types of genes oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes These mutations are sometimes called drivers of cancer Altered oncogenes stop regulating cell division allowing cells to grow and survive when they should not Tumour suppressor genes which would normally stop cancer are altered and enable cells to divide uncontrollably When Cancer Spreads In metastasis c ancer cells break away from where they first formed primary cancer travel through the blood or lymph system and form new tumours metastatic tumours in other parts of the body Under a microscope metastatic cancer',\n",
       " '3 P IP Digest cells generally share molecular feat ures with the original cancer including specific chromosome changes For this reason the original and metastatic tumours are considered the same type of cancer For instance breast cancer that metastasizes in the lung is metastatic breast cancer not lung cancer Metastatic tumours can severely damage how the body functions Most people who die of cancer die of metastatic disease Most treatments for metastatic cancers are designed to relieve symptoms and control the size of tumours and their further spread But reducing cancer deaths requires curing metastatic disease outright Tissue Changes that Are Not Cancer Not every change in the body s tissues is cancer though many may develop into cancer if they are not treated The diagram on the next page shows the progression of cellular changes that may lead to cancer Hyperplasia occurs when cells within a tissue divide faster than normal and build up or proliferate The cells and the way the tissue is organized look normal under a microscope Hyperplasi a can be caused by chronic irritation or several other factors Dysplasia is more serious than hyperplasia Dysplasia also involves a buildup of extra cells but the cells look abnormal and there are changes in how the tissue is organized In general the more abnormal the cells and tissue look the greater the chance that cancer will form Some types of dysplasia may need to be monitored or treated For example an abnormal skin mole called a dysplastic may turn into melanoma An even more serious condition is carcinoma in situ Carcinoma in situ is not invasive cancer because the abnormal cells do not spread beyond the original tissue But because some carcinomas in situ become invasive they are usually treated Cancer Progression Source 6 Cancer progression from NI H png',\n",
       " '4 P IP Digest Types of Cancer 2 There are more than 100 types of cancer Cancers are usually named for the organs or tissues where they form For example lung cancer starts in lung cells and brain cancer in brain cells Cancers also may be described by the type of cell that formed them such as an epithelial cell or a squamous cell Carcinomas are the most common type of cancer They are formed by epithelial cells which are the cells that cover the inside and outside surfaces of the body There are many types of epithelial cells which often have a column like shape when viewed under a m icroscope Carcinomas that begin in different epithelial cell types have specific names Adenocarcinoma forms in epithelial cells that produce fluids or mucus Tissues with this type of epithelial cell are sometimes called glandular tissues Most cancers of the breast colon and prostate are adenocarcinomas Basal cell carcinoma begins in the lower or basal base layer of the epidermis or outer layer of skin Squamous cell carcinoma forms in squamous cells which grow just beneath the outer surface of t he skin They also line many other organs including the stomach intestines lungs bladder and kidneys Under a microscope Squamous cells look flat like fish scales Squamous cell carcinomas are sometimes called epidermoid carcinomas Transitional cel l carcinoma forms in a type of epithelial tissue called transitional epithelium or urothelium This tissue made up of many layers of epithelial cells lines the bladder ureters a part of the kidneys called the renal pelvis and other organs Some cancers of the bladder ureters and kidneys are transitional cell carcinomas Sarcomas are cancers that form in bone and soft tissues including muscle fat blood vessels lymph vessels and fibrous tissue such as tendons and ligaments Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer Common soft tissue sarcomas include leiomyosarcoma Kaposi sarcoma malignant fibrous histiocytoma liposarcoma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans Leukemias are cancers that begin in the blood forming tissue of the bone marrow also called liquid tumours Large numbers of abnormal white blood cells leukemia cells and leukemic blast cells build up in the blood and bone marrow crowding out normal blood cells and making it harder for the body to deliver oxygen control bleeding and fight infections The four common categories of leukemia are based on how quickly they progress acute or chronic and the type of blood cell they start in lymphoblastic or myeloid Lymphoma begins in lymphocytes T cells or B cells These diseas e fighting white blood cells are part of the immune system With lymphoma abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes and vessels as well as in other organs There are two main types of lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma People with this disease have abnormal lymphocytes called Reed Sternberg cells These cells usually form from B cells 2 Adapted from cancer understanding what is cancer',\n",
