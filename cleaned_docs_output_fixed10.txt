Diabetes 22 M ED IC AT IO N In some patients diet control and exercises are not adequate for achieving acceptable blood glucose levels These patientsrequire medication either in the form of oral drugs orinsulin injections Diet and exercise need to be continued as a part of treatment of diabetes Basically oral medication is of following major types sulfonylurea available commercially as daonil Glynase euglucon anddimicron and biguinides marketed as Glyciphase Walaphase Thesehave different modes of action The doctor will decide the suitable typeand dose of medicine You may need one or more tablets if the controlof your blood glucose is not possible by following a healthy eating planor by being active These tablets lower blood glucose in different ways For example sulfonylurea lowers blood glucose by helping the pancreasmake more insulin Sulfonylureas have to be taken half an hour beforefood Whereas biguanides reduce blood glucose by decreasing the liver sproduction of glucose It also causes the muscle to use glucose moreefficiently The two other new types of medicines like Acarbose andinsulin sensitizers work in other ways Acarbose reduces absorption ofglucose from intestine It has to be taken just before first bite of lunchand dinner These medicines have specific indications It is again importantto remind you at this stage that no two patients are similarno two patients are similarno two patients are similarno two patients are similarno two patients are similar Hence do Hence do not compare your doses or type of tablet with other patients not compare your doses or type of tablet with other patients not compare your doses or type of tablet with other patients not compare your doses or type of tablet with other patients not compare your doses or type of tablet with other patients Do not take tablets prescribed to some other patient when you run out of stockor while away from home Always carry sufficient quantity of yourmedicine with you These tablets should be avoided in pregnancy diabetes associated with severe heart diseases kidney and liver diseases or youngdiabetics After years of use sometimes oral medicine may not showrequired effects on blood sugar This is called primary or secondary drug

D IA BE TE S Jyothi Vijayaraghavan Judy S Crabtree Ph D Diabetes mellitus or simply diabetes is a chronic disease affecting about 25 8 million people in the United States making it the seventh leading cause of death What is Diabetes Diabetes is a met abolic disorder in which there are high levels of sugar in the blood a condition called hyperglycemia Under normal conditions food is broken down to glucose which then enters the bloodstream and acts as fuel for the body The p ancreas produces a hormone called insulin which helps to carry glucose from the bloodstream into muscle fat and liver where it can be used as fuel Diabetics are not able to move this sugar out of the bloodstream because of two primary reasons 1 their pancreas do es not produce e nough insulin and or 2 their cells do not respond normally to insulin a condition called insulin resistance This is why people with diabetes have high blood sugar levels Types of diabetes 1 Type 1 diabetes T 1 D Juvenile diabetes Insulin dependen t diabetes T 1 D affects both adults and children at any age and occurs when the person s pancreas stop producing insulin due to destruction of the pancreatic beta cells or by inactivity of these insulin producing cells Affected individuals depend on daily injections of insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels The causes of T 1 D are not entirely understood however scientists believe that both genetic and environmental factors are involved 2 Type 2 diabetes Non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus T 2 D or N ID DM This is the most common form of diabetes that most often occu rs in adulthood However because of increased obesity rates and sedentary lifestyles teens and young adults are also being diagnosed with T 2 D or the precursor pre Source homeremedies com blog top 8 risk factors of type 2 diabetes

healthcare costs have threatened many nations fi nancial health and the eff ort needed to care for the ill and dying aff ects national productivity It has become abundantly clear that the economic development of countries is tightly linked to the health of its citizens Poor health both individual and public along with lack of education and lack of an enabling political structure are major impediments to a country s development and are the roots of poverty Poor health impoverishes nations and poverty causes poor health in part related to inadequate access to quality healthcare Even more distressing is the enormous suff ering that living with illness causes Th ose who are most disadvantaged suff er most due to poor health Many of the biggest causes of the burden of poor health are the so called noncommunicable diseases N CDs which include asthma C OP D and cancers Wi th this awareness in 2011 the United Nations convened a high level meeting on N CDs to develop a global plan for their prevention and control 11 Th e F IR S has been part of this eff ort It strongly believes that investing in public health pays dividends in many ways Healthcare costs for respiratory diseases are an increasing burden on the economies of all countries For example the annual cost of asthma in the U SA is estimated to be 18 billion 12 If one considers the lost productivity of family members and others caring for these individuals the cost to society is far greater 7 Forum of International Respiratory Societies



T HE B IG 5 Five respiratory conditions account for a great burden to society Th ese are 1 C OP D 2 asthma 3 acute respiratory infections 4 T B and 5 lung cancer

C OP D Scope of the disease C OP D aff ects more than 200 million people and is the fourth leading cause of death in the world 5 C OP D is the only major disease that is increasing in prevalence worldwide and on all continents 13 15 Furthermore studies show that underdiagnosis ranges 72 93 which is higher than that reported for hypertension hypercholesterolemia and similar di sorders Misdiagnosis is also common 16 Th e most important factor leading to the development of C OP D is tobacco smoking Tobacco smoke causes destruction of lung tissue and obstruction of the small airways leading to emphysema and bronchitis which are the main diseases of C OP D Indoor smoke inhaled occupational exposures through farming mining construction transportation and manufacturing pose risks for C OP D globally Other risks for C OP D include genetic syndromes such as 1 antitrypsin defi ciency outdoor air pollution and other diseases that involve the airways such as chronic asthma and T B 17 Smoke exposure in childhood may predispose to the development of chronic lung disease in adult life 18 Prevention Reduction of smoking is the fi rst and most important priority in preventing C OP D Th is measure will also greatly reduce the morbidity and mortality of other lung diseases Chimney cook stoves and other devices that decrease indoor smoke exposure lessen the risk of respiratory infections in children and potentially the incidence of C OP D in non smokers especially women Controlling occupational exposure to dust and fumes will have important benefi ts in reducing the burden of C OP D Treatment Spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of C OP D to avoid misdiagnosis and evaluate the severity of airfl ow limitation Identifi cation and reduction of exposure to risk factors are essential to prevent and treat the disease and avoiding other prec ipitating factors and air pollution is important All individuals who smoke should be encouraged and enab led to quit Inhaled bronchodilators are the main medicines that help these patients Long term treatment with inhaled corticosteroids added to long acting bronchodilators can help patients with frequent exacerbations and severe airfl ow obstruction 10 Forum of International Respiratory Societies

Patients with low levels of oxygen in their blood may require supplemental oxygen Maintaining physical fi tness is key because diffi culty breathing may lead to a lack of activity and subsequent deconditioning Th erefore exercise based pulmonary rehabilitation is important for most people with C OP D Treating coexisting illnesses can extend life in many patients Vaccination against seasonal infl uenza may reduce the risk of severe exacerbations triggered by infl uenza Th e Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease G OL D is an organisation that has developed recommendations on the management of C OP D and has guided many national and international programmes 5 Despite the availability of guidelines several studies have showed that C OP D is undertreated in its early as well as advanced stages In Latin America only about one quarter of people with C OP D were treated according to these standards 19 Control or elimination Th e key element of reducing and controlling C OP D is reducing and controlling tobacco use Th is best addressed through political and public health initiatives Public health and societal eff orts are needed to reduce indoor smoke exposure and develop cost eff ective management protocols for C OP D in low income settings Research could lead to better understanding of how risk factors and comorbidities interact to aff ect the severity of disease and what other factors cause C OP D in smokers and non smokers Other research questions include how to identify and treat early C OP D and how to manage it in the context of concomitant conditions such as sleep apnoea cardiovascular disease depression osteoporosis diabetes lung cancer ageing and frailty

Asthma Scope of the disease Asthma affl icts about 235 million people worldwide 1 and it has been increasing during the past three decades in both developed and developing countries Although it strikes all ages races and ethnicities wide variation exists in diff erent countries and in diff erent groups within the same country It is the most common chronic disease in children and is more severe in children in non affl uent countries In these settings underdiagnosis and under treatment are common and eff ective medicines may not be available or aff ordable Th e burden of asthma is also greater in urban settings It is one of the most frequent reasons for preventable hospital admissions among children 20 21 Asthma causes about 180 000 deaths worldwide each year 22 In some studies asthma accounts for over 30 of all paediatric hospitalisations and nearly 12 of readmissions within 180 days of discharge 21 Th e cause of the increase in global prevalence of as thma is not well understood Genetic predisposition exposure to environmental allergens air pollution dietary factors and abnormal immunological responses all promote the development of asthma Th e timing and level of exposure to allergens and irritants may be crucial factors leading to the development of disease Early viral infections and passive tobacco smoke exposure have been associated with the development of asthma in young children Airborne allergens and irritants associated with asthma occur in the workplace and can lead to chronic and debilitating disease if the exposure persists Prevention Th e cause of most asthma is unknown and thus its prevention is problematic People who smoke and have asthma have a much more rapid decline in lung function than those who do not smoke Avoiding smoking during pregnancy and avoidance of passive smoke exposure aft er birth can reduce asthma severity in children Occupational asthma has taught us that early removal of allergens or irritants may ablate or reduce the disease Treatment Asthma is a generally a lifelong disease that is not curable but eff ective treatment can alleviate the symptoms Inhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone of eff ective asthma treatment When used appropriately i e taken regularly with a spacer or other device to assist inhalation these medicines can decrease the severity and frequency of symptoms of asthma Th ey also reduce the need for reliever inhalers rapid acting bronchodilators and the frequency of severe episodes exacerbations requiring urgent medical care emergency room visits and hospitalisations Inhaled bronchodilators are important to give quick relief from asthma symptoms 12 Forum of International Respiratory Societies

Unfortunately many people suff ering from asthma do not have access to eff ective asthma medicines Even though inhaled cort icosteroids and inhaled bronchodilators are on the essential drug list of the World Health Organization W HO they are either unavailable or unaff ordable in many low income countries Universal access to eff ective proven therapies for controlling asthma and treating exacerbations is an essential requirement to combat this disease Lack of availability of medicines is not the only reason that people with asthma do not receive eff ective care Widespread misconceptions about the nature of the disease and its treatment oft en prevent people from using the most appropriate treatments Educational campaigns to encourage the use of inhaled corticosteroids and avoidance of exposures that trigger asthma attacks are an important part of eff ective asthma control programmes Control or elimination Research is critical to better understand the origins of asthma the causes of exacerbations and the reasons for its rising worldwide prevalence Th e International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood I SA AC has provided insights into the disease and facilitated standardised research on asthma in children that has helped to defi ne the prevalence trends and determinants of asthma and allergies worldwide 23 Th e Global Initiative for Asthma G IN A has developed an evidence based strategy for the management of asthma Dissemination and implementation of this strategy will improve asthma control Making inhaled corticosteroids bronchodilators and spacer devices widely available at an aff ordable price and educating people with asthma about the disease and its management are key steps to improve outcomes for people with asthma Policy makers should develop and apply eff ective means of quality assurance within health services for respiratory diseases at all levels Strategies to reduce indoor air pollution smoke exposure and respiratory infections will enhance asthma control

Acute respiratory infections Scope of the disease Respiratory infections account for more than 4 million deaths annually and are the leading cause of death in developing countries 24 Since these deaths are preventable with adequate medical care a much higher proportion of them occur in low income countries Pneumonia is the most common serious respiratory infection In children under 5 years of age pneumonia accounts for 18 of all deaths or more than 1 3 million annually 6 pneumonia kills far more than H IV or malaria 24 Risk factors for pneumonia include living in crowded conditions malnutrition lack of immunisation H IV and exposure to tobacco or indoor smoke In Africa pneumonia is one of the most frequent reasons for adults being admitted to hospital one in ten of these patients die from their disease It is several f old higher in the elderly and H IV infected individuals Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most frequent bacterial cause of pneumonia H IV infection increases the risk of pneumonia caused by this organism twenty fold 25 Pneumonia can also lead to chronic respiratory disease such as bronchiectasis Viral respiratory infections can occur in epidemics and can spread rapidly within communities across the globe Every year infl uenza causes respiratory tract infections in 5 15 of the population and severe illness in 3 5 million people 10 In 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome S AR S caused by a previously unrecognised coronavirus rapidly spread throughout th e world Its lethality mobilised international eff orts that rapidly identifi ed the cause and the method of spread Stringent infection control measures reduced its spread and were so eff ective that no further cases were identifi ed 26 Th is in stark contrast to the 1918 infl uenza pandemic that claimed the lives of between 30 and 150 million persons Prevention Vaccination is one of the greatest achievements of public health Primary prevention strategies for respiratory infections are based on immunisation programmes that have been developed for both viruses and bacteria Bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia S pneumoniae and Haemophilus infl uenzae type b most frequently cause severe pneumonia in children Vaccines are eff ective against these agents as well as measles and pertussis whooping cough Th e infl uenza vaccine is eff ective in preventing infl uenza in adults 14 Forum of International Respiratory Societies

and children Th e S pneumoniae conjugate vaccine is highly eff ective in reducing pneumonia in children but this vaccine is still not available as part of a national expanded programme for immunisation in many low income countries Childhood respiratory disease can be prevented or ameliorated by several basic measures improving childhood nutrition promoting breastfeeding ensuring comprehensive immunisation improving living conditions to prevent crowding avoiding tobacco smoke exposure reducing indoor air pollution and treating H IV and preventing mother to child H IV transmission Treatment Most bacterial respiratory infections are treatable with antibiotics and most viral infections are self limited Y et millions of people die of pneumonia Th e failure to prevent these deaths largely results from lack of access to healthcare or the inability of the healthcare system to care for these individuals Th e most eff ective way to manage these diseases is through standard case management Case management is defi ned as a collaborative process of assessment planning facilitation care coordination evaluation and advocacy for options and services to meet an individual s and family s comprehensive health needs through communication and available resources to promote quality cost eff ective outcomes 27 For childhood pneumonia this involves a standard approach to diagnosis and treatment as has been developed by the W HO in the Integrated Ma nagement of Childhood Illness programme Th e contribution of case management is well illustrated in the Child Lung Health services developed in Malawi in collaboration with Th e Union In this resource limited country adopting a standardised case management programme training health workers and developing the infrastructure to implement the programme ste adily improved the outcome for children under 5 years of age with pneumonia 28 Th e cornerstone of pneumonia management is appropriate diagnosis and use of antibiotics Control or elimination Vaccines are essential for the control and elimination of disease New conjugate vaccines must be available as part of expanded programmes for immunisation in all countries Development of improved vaccines with broader coverage is needed to control or eliminate specifi c infections Antibiotics have made most bacterial pneumonia easily curable As with other diseases in which the causes are known and cures are available key eff orts must be in improving the availability and delivery of quality healthcare and medicine Diag nosis must be made earlier which entails more awareness in the community Better diagnostic tests include more eff ective sampling procedures and better methods for rapid laboratory detection of infectious agents or microbial molecules in sputum blood and urine Improved diagnosis enables targeted therapy More intelligent use of antibiotics will decrease the huge problem of antimicrobial drug resistance Misuse of antibiotics leads to the emergence and selection of resistant bacteria Physicians worldwide now face situations where infected patients cannot be treated adequately because the responsible bacterium is totally resistant to available antibiotics Th ree strategic areas of intervention include 1 prudent use of available antibiotics giving them only when they are needed with the correct diagnosis and in the correct dosage dose intervals and duration 2 hygienic precautions to control transmission of resistant strains between persons including hand hygiene screening for carriage of resistant strains and isolation of positive patients and 3 research and development of eff ective antibiotics with new mechanisms of action 29 monia mme for res munisatiion n ducing on ions are hs largelyy for thesseee Case care and o promomoootetetee nt as has ramme ces y adopti nnnngn the n under propriateteeeeeeeee s must pment off ctions n which ability anddd ils more ocedures ecules in crease tthheeeh gence anandddddd dd patientnttss ss vailable ibiotics osage ddddooososooooe ins betwewweweeeeweweeweeweene n of chanismmss s

Tuberculosis Scope of the disease In 2011 there were about 8 7 million new cases of T B 13 were also infected with H IV 4 T B killed 1 4 million people and took an extraordinary high toll in parts of Africa About 80 of global H IV T B cases occurred in Africa where T B is the leading cause of H IV related mortality 30 T B is contagious airborne and therefore clusters in countries and regions 22 countries account for 80 of existing cases of tuberculosis worldwide 4 Multidrug resistant T B is increasing and approached 60 000 cases in 2011 4 Eastern Europe has been particularly hard hit by drug resistant disease Th e good news is that the intense multinational eff orts for T B control of the past decade have paid dividends New cases are falling at a rate of about 2 2 per year and mortality has dropped 41 since 1990 4 New diagnostic tests and drugs are becoming available and considerable progress is being made in understanding the bacterium and developing vaccines Unfortunately this progress masks other persistent serious problems and regional variations Individuals become infected by inhaling tuberculous bacteria T B usually develops subtly so that initially people may not know they are infected Only about one in 10 infected but otherwise healthy people develop symptomatic disease although this rate is much higher in young children and people with H IV or certain other illnesses Th e disease lies dormant because the infection is contained by the body s immune system but can become active at any point in the person s lifetime Active disease usually develops slowly so that individuals may cough and spread the disease without knowing it With the ease and frequency of international travel spread to other people is easy No one is safe from T B until the world is safe from T B T B is a particular problem in children where diagnosis is more diffi cult Infants and young children are especially susceptible to developing severe or disseminated T B T B can strain national healthcare systems because of the eff ort and cost needed for contact tracing and treatment especially if the bacteria are resistant to commonly used drugs Prevention In no disease is the phrase treatment is prevention truer than with T B Th e factors promoting the spread of infection relate to the chance that an uninfected individual is exposed to those with infectious T B the more cases in the community the more likely it is that an individual will become infected Factors promoting the development of disease in infected individuals relate to the function of the immune system Th e most potent factor is infection with H IV but other conditions that aff ect immunity such as certain medications and the presence of poorly controlled diabetes increase the risk of developing active disease 16 Forum of International Respiratory Societies

Comprehensive public health programmes that locate cases and contacts and eff ectively treat T B reduce the presence of the bacteria in society and thus prevent its spread Treatment of contacts of patients with active T B and those with latent T B that are at high risk for developing active disease such as those with H IV reduces the number of cases of active T B Th e treatment of H IV also reduces T B Th e current vaccine Bacille Calmette Gu rin B CG is largely ineff ective for pulmonary T B but off ers some protection against disseminated T B However research centres around the world are working on developing new vaccines for T B Treatment Most cases of T B can be cured if diagnosed early and treated appropriately However T B is a complicated disease that can be diffi cult to diagnose and treat there are many nuances to its management T B is best managed by a standardised approach that is based on evidence derived from clinical trials Th e long duration of therapy usually 6 months with three or four drugs in uncomplicated cases makes adherence to treatment challenging especially in individuals who are taking other drugs for chronic diseases such as H IV Failure to take the full course of prescribed drugs may result in relapse with drug resistant disease which is more diffi cult to treat and poses a risk to others who could be infected by that person For this reason supervised or directly observed therapy is recommended to ensure adherence throughout the course of treatment for T B To complement the standard case management promoted by the W HO through its Stop T B Department the Tuberculosis Coalition for Technical Assistance developed a document to engage all providers in the best care for T B patients wherever they may be found 31 Control or elimination Many areas of T B research are producing encouraging results Diagnosis is oft en diffi cult because it has generally relied on observing bacteria microscopically in the sputum New diagnostic technologies such as Gene Xpert M TB R IF which analyse sputum for mycobacterial D NA are signifi cantly more sensitive than microscopic sputum smear examination In addition D NA technology can detect drug resistance Th ese tools are becoming available to high prevalence countries where drug resistance is a major problem Scaling up this technology and enabling treatment for drug resistance are major challenges If fi rst line standard antituberculous medicines cannot be used because of drug resistance drug intolerance or drug interactions treatment must extend much longer Treating drug resistant disease costs much more and the chance of cure is much less Fortunately several new drugs are on the horizon for drug resistant disease Shorter course therapy for both sensitive and resistant T B is urgently needed to further reduce the prevalence of this disease Shorter duration of therapy is also needed for latent T B A recent study showed that the treatment with only 12 weekly doses of medicine directly observed over 3 months was as good as the current 9 month daily regimen 32 Public health eff orts to reduce the T B burden include the W HO s 3 Is initiative intensifi ed case fi nding isoniazid preventive therapy and improved infection control 4

Lung cancer Scope of the disease Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world making up 12 7 of the total reported cancers and aff ecting over 1 61 million people annually Lung cancer is also the most common cause of cancer death killing 1 37 million per year or about 18 of the total cancer deaths 9 Lung cancer has the highest fatality rate of all major cancers its ratio of mortality to incidence is 0 86 9 In the U SA lung cancer causes more deaths than breas t colon and prostate cancer combined Tobacco smoke is the cause of most cases of lung cancer Many components of tobacco smoke mutate D NA and are carcinogenic Th ese eff ects correlate with the amount and duration of smoking Since damage accumulates over time lung cancer occurs years aft er people begin smoking As smoking rates rise lung cancer rates follow Although most lung cancer is associated with sm oking it can occur in non smokers especially in those who are passively exposed to tobacco smoke Among those who do not smoke and do not live with those who do exposure to smoke from biomass fuel is a cause of lung cancer Exposure to radon asbestos and other environmental and workplace elements also causes lung cancer Although asbestos is now banned in 52 countries it is still in the environment in buildings and previous manufacturing sites Some countries where its use is banned still produce and market it to poorer countries this must stop Prevention Lung cancer is largely preventable through smoking prevention and cessation At the beginning of the 20 th century lung cancer and smoking were rare As the number of smokers grew the number of lung cancer cases grew about 20 years later Smoking began to decrease in the last third of the 20 th century in certain countries and lung cancer is now slowly declining in those countries Public programmes that reduce smoking are urgently needed to halt the rise in respiratory cancers in nations where smoking has increased because the incidence of lung cancer w ill also increase in those countries Environmental causes of lung cancer such as radon and asbestos can be monitored and reduced Lung cancer can also occur in non smokers without known en vironmental exposure Research is needed to determine other causes of lung cancer Treatment Th e care of patients with lung cancer is complex To guide treatment and to determine prognosis lung cancer patients undergo a staging process Early stage lu ng cancer is treated with surgery More advanced stages may benefi t from chemotherapy or radiation therapy or a combination of these interventions Patients who have advanced stage lung cancer are rarely cured of their disease Individualised or 18 Forum of International Respiratory Societies

personalised therapy directed to factors such as specifi c mutations may improve the results of treatment Research is ongoing to identify targets in diff erent patients with diff erent lung cancers that can give a greater chance of cure with fewer side eff ects Treatment of lung cancer in the elderly and people with other serious health problems poses a challenge Th e benefi ts of treatment must be balanced against the risks of adverse eff ects in individual patients Patients with lung cancer and H IV infection tend to be relatively young but they usually present with advanced disease and have a poor prognosis Treatment with chemotherapy in people with H IV may be diffi cult because of drug interactions and toxicity Identifying and treating early cancer is a potential lifesaving strategy A national lung cancer screening trial undertaken in the U SA was the largest 53 454 participants randomised trial of a single cancer screening test in the history of U S medicine Th e study randomly assigned current and former smokers to plain chest radiography control or low dose chest computed tomography intervention yearly for 3 years and followed them for another 3 5 years Th e study showed a 20 reduction in lung cancer specifi c deaths in the intervention group and a 7 reduction in overall mortality However of those screened a quarter had an abnormal test result and 96 of these were false positive meaning that many people will need additional investigations as a result of screening and most of these will not derive any benefi t from these investigations Hence screening is likely to be costly but as of yet there have been no cost eff ectiveness studies with this technology Control or elimination Th e fi rst strategy for control and elimination of lung cancer lies with eff orts to decrease smoking by helping current smokers to stop and developing methods to decrease the number of people who start smoking It is important to limit smoke exposure in the workplace and home Legislation to regulate tobacco use and its promotion to eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke in public areas and to raise taxes on tobacco products are proven techniques that decrease tobacco use Th ese are particularly important in countries where smoking rates are rising Comparative eff ectiveness research into strategies aimed at tobacco reduction cessation and public policy is needed Research into improving early diagnosis understanding genetic and molecular mechanisms that infl uence carcinogenesis and predicting tumour behavior and genetic predisposition to lung cancer is important Th e identifi cation of better screening tools is also important for secondary prevention

What can be done to combat respiratory disease Prevention Th e fi rst step for respiratory health is to prevent illness before it occurs Identifying and ameliorating the factors that cause or promote respiratory diseases can prevent them especially because respiratory diseases are oft en linked to the environment Respiratory conditions are preventable to a greater degree than diseases in any other system Th e cost of prevention is only a fraction of the cost of treatment Because preventing and combating respiratory disease is so cost eff ective targeting respiratory diseases represents a best buy as described by the W HO 33 Breathing unhealthy air is a cause or contributor to most respiratory conditions Th e most common sources of unhealthy air are tobacco smoke indoor air pollution from burning solid fuels unhealthy air in the workplace air pollution from traffi c and industrial sources air containing microbes and air with toxic particles or fumes Th e fi rst step in preventing lung disease is reduction of tobacco use Smoking was estimated to be responsible for one in seven deaths in men and one in 15 deaths in women globally in 2004 It is projected that as many as 1 billion people will die from tobacco smoking in the 21 st century 34 Of these deaths the greatest proportion is due to respiratory diseases including lung cancers In the U SA current smokers are 25 times more likely to die of lung cancer than those who never smoked 35 Th e rate of death from all causes is three times higher in smokers than non smokers and life expectancy is shortened by 10 years in smokers 36 In Europe the total health cost of tobacco is about 544 billion annually which represents about 5 of the European Union G DP 37 Tobacco smoking is a global problem that can be solved Intensive campaigns in western Europe and North and South America have decreased the number of smokers in several countries but the tobacco industry moved its target to susceptible populations in eastern Europe Asia and developing countries to increase sales of its products An estimated 350 million Chinese smoke an average of 11 cigarettes per day a level of smoking that has not been seen in western countries in 50 years Passive smoke exposure also leads to respiratory disease Children who are exposed to tobacco smoke before birth from a smoking pregnant mother or as infants have a greater risk of developing wheezing associated illnesses pneumonia and asthma Th e fi rst international treaty developed for purposes of health was the W HO s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 38 It is an important mechanism through which governments can control the 20 Forum of International Respiratory Societies

21 Forum of International Respiratory Societiestobacco industry by using laws regulations admini strative decisions and enforcement measures Eff ective strategies termed M PO WE R 34 have been developed by the W HO Tobacco Free Initiative to support implementation of the Framework to prevent and reduce smoking and the demand for tobacco products F IR S calls on all governments communities healthcare practitioners and individuals to promote these eff ective preventive measures that have reduced tobacco consumption in many countries Much however remains to be done particularly in low and middle income countries to mitigate the pernicious impact of tobacco smoking Poor indoor air quality is an important contributor to respiratory disease About 50 of all households in the world and 90 of rural households use solid fuels exposing 2 3 billion people to noxious smoke 39 Th e W HO estimates that 1 6 million deaths and 38 5 million D AL Ys per year can be attributed to indoor smoke Most disease and death attributable to exposure to poor indoor air quality occurs in women and children especially in low income families 40 Exposure to indoor smoke used for heating and cooking leads to C OP D lung cancer and in children pneumonia and asthma 41 People with lung disease are particularly susceptible to the eff ects of outdoor air pollution Increased concentrations of airborne fi ne particles are associated with incr eased hospital admissions and deaths 42 44 It is estimated that poor air quality in Europe leads to an average loss of 8 6 months of life expectancy 45 Th ere is a growing body of evidence that air pollution aff ects the unborn child leading to enhanced susceptibility to infectious respiratory and cardiovasc ular disease 46 Children especially those with chronic lung disease are also more susceptible to the adverse eff ects of air pollution 47 Th e environmental risks are greater in low and middle income countries and among the disadvantaged and low socioeconomic sections of society Th e respiratory societies of the world believe that everyone has the right to breathe clean air 45 and we ask lawmakers to enact and enforce clean air standards in all countries Th e health benefi ts of clean air policies are far reaching In one large urban area it was estimated that complying with current standards would reduce the annual death toll by 1 200 deaths per year reduce the hospitalisations for heart and lung diseases by 600 per year reduce the cases of chronic bronchitis in adults by 1 900 per year reduce the cases of acute bronchitis in children by 12 100 per year and reduce asthma attacks in children and adults by 18 700 per year 48 Greater improvements in air quality would yield greater benefi ts According to the W HO Reductions in air pollution over the past two decades have been shown to be associated with increases in life expectancy in the U SA and improved respiratory health 45 Legislation and political action on clean air makes a diff erence Appropriate nutrition and physical activity are critical for health Both malnutrition and obesity contribute to respiratory diseases In western societies obesity is linked with obstructive sleep apnoea asthma heart disease and diabetes Malnutrition is an important risk factor for childhood pneumonia and severe illness Prevention of respiratory disease entails strengthening healthcare systems u sing established guidelines for health promotion and disease prevention training medical personnel and educating the populace Treatment and cure Once disease occurs the goal is to lessen its eff ects and to cure it if possible Reducing its eff ects is best accomplished by early detection prompt diagnosis and early eff ective treatment Successful treatment is based on sound medical evidence is cost eff ective and is generally in accordance with standardised guidelines Patients and healthcare workers can manage diseases better if they are properly trained and resources are available Th e W HO F IR S members and other respiratory societies have developed recommendations for standards of care for specifi c clinical conditions Unfortunately eff ective and uniform implementation promotion and adherence to these standards have been lacking Great medical breakthroughs are not signifi cant if they do not reach the communities and patients that need them Healthcare delivery can be readily improved with programmatic research education a trained work force funding infrastructure and an effi cient system in which to operate

Economic barriers limit access to care even in many resource rich settings Many people simply cannot aff ord to obtain good quality care In resource poor settings many people do not seek care from the public system because it is lacking poor in quality or inaccessi ble In many countries public healthcare systems are seen as a drain on public coff ers Th ey are vulnerable to abrupt change in funding which depends on the political and economic climate In some countries there are health insurance systems that limit medication or services Elsewhere governments have defi ned an essential package of care but that care may not be adequate Restrictions on healthcare should be based on evidence based standards of care Disease control and global reduction or elimination Th e F IR S vision of controlling and eliminating respiratory diseases requires use of the current eff ective tools coupled with additional research Antibiotics can cure most pneumonia or T B and smoking cessation programmes can be eff ective yet enormous problems remain in managing these illnesses In the last few years application of what is available bolstered by research has reduced the rate of pneumonia and T B worldwide 4 and tobacco use in certain countries Th ese successes must stimulate the world to consolidate and extend these gains to more countries and regions It cannot be a shortsighted rationale for reducing eff ort In addition to public health measures developing healthcare capacity requires the education of clinicians and researchers Several F IR S member societies have crea ted training programmes Nearly two decades ago the American Th oracic Society developed the Methods in Clinical and Operational Research M EC OR programme in Latin America to increase the numbers of public health academic and clinical leaders to facilitate research and its application to public health and healthcare related to respiratory diseases Th ese courses are now also available in Asia and Africa and the programme has trained more than 1000 healthcare workers worldwide Th e Asociaci n Latinoamericana de T rax has now taken over the courses in Latin America Th e Pan African Th oracic Society has developed similar courses that have operated since 2007 Th e Union has many programmes for operational research and management training Administration is an important component of the healthcare system that is oft en ignored Th e European Respiratory Society has sought to improve respiratory care in Europe by developing a Europe wide curriculum and examination Harmonised Education in Respiratory Medicine for European Specialists H ER ME S which is now used by many jurisdictions as an authorised postgraduate examination in respiratory medicine Th e American College of Chest Physicians off ers dedicated courses attended by participants from around the world specifi cally designed to fortify the skills necessary for subspecialty certifi cation in pulmonary medicine Th e other main tool to reduce respiratory diseases lies in research Public health and clinical research improves and promotes health for a population by improving the ability of healthcare systems to deal with disease and to set improved guidelines and standards for the care of patients Basic research aims to uncover the mechanism of disease and develop newer and better diagnostic tools or treatments to alleviate or cure diseases Th e investment in respiratory research has paid enormous dividends People are living longer and healthier and we are on the threshold of even greater advances Many diseases now have genetic profi les and scientists are working hard to uncover the basic processes that go wrong in disease Th e complicated network of cells signals and structures is being identifi ed and used to identify susceptible individuals develop better diagnostic tests and fi nd new treatments Equally important is research on how to apply new research fi ndings to help control disease Th e results of clinical trials are distilled into guidelines on how best to manage an illness Th ese evidence based recommendations can be powerful tools to secure uniform high quality medical care throughout the world Respiratory medical research has been shown to represent a six fold return on investment 49 Knowledge created through research is cross cultural and enduring 22 Forum of International Respiratory Societies

23 Forum of International Respiratory Societies Respiratory diseases are an enormous challenge to life health and productive human activity Prevention cure and control of these diseases and promotion of respiratory health must be the top priorities in global decision making in the health sector Investment in respiratory health will pay manifold dividends in longevity healthy living days and national economies Public awareness and control of the environment are important steps in preventing respiratory diseases Th e key controllable factors are reduction in tobacco smoking and improvement in air quality which includes reduction in second hand tob acco smoke smoke from indoor fi res and unhealthy public and workplace air Strengthening childhood immunisation programmes and greater availability of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine must be prioritised in low income countries Improved nutrition especially in pregnant women and children can have long term benefi ts Prevention and timely treatment of H IV can have a major impact in reducing the burden of respiratory illness Eff ective training of healthcare workers and making medication and appropriate diagnostics available are keys to better lung health T B and pneumonia are two respiratory diseases that can be cured and controlled if the resources devoted to them are increased Finally research in respiratory diseases is the hope for today and the promise for tomorrow Research must answer many questions how do lung diseases arise how do they spread who is vulnerable and what actions can be used control or cure them to name a few Research must also help us understand what keeps people healthy Measures developed from the research must be cost eff ective and widely applicable Increased funding to support respiratory research is needed Summary

What Is Heart Disease Coronary heart disease often simply called heart disease occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle becomehardened and narrowed due to a buildup of plaque on the arteries inner walls Plaque is the accumulation of fat cholesterol and othersubstances As plaque continues to build up in the arteries bloodflow to the heart is reduced Heart disease can lead to a heart attack A heart attack happens when an artery becomes totally blocked with plaque preventingvital oxygen and nutrients from getting to the heart A heart attackcan cause permanent damage to the heart muscle Heart disease is one of several cardiovascular diseases which are disorders of the heart and blood vessel system Other cardiovasculardiseases include stroke high blood pressure and rheumatic heartdisease Some people aren t too concerned about heart disease because they think it can be cured with surgery This is a myth Heart disease is a lifelong condition Once you get it you ll always have it It s true that procedures such as angioplasty and bypass surgery can help blood and oxygen flow more easily to the heart But the arter ies remain damaged which means you are still more likely to have a heart attack What s more the condition of your blood vessels will steadily worsen unless you make changes in your daily habits and control your risk factors Many people die of complications from heart disease or become permanently disabled That s why it is so vital to take action to prevent this disease 3 What You Need To Know About Heart Disease What You Need To Know About Heart Disease

What Is Blood Pressure Blood pressure is the amount of force exerted by the blood againstthe walls of the arteries Everyone has to have some blood pressure so that blood can get to all of the body s organs Usually bloodpressure is expressed as two numbers such as 120 80 and is measured in millimeters of mercury mm Hg The first number is the systolic blood pressure the amount of force used when the heart beats The second number or diastolic blood pressure is thepressure that exists in the arteries between heartbeats Because blood pressure changes often your health care provider should check it on several different days before deciding whether it istoo high Blood pressure is considered high when it stays aboveprehypertensive levels over a period of time See accompanying box 13 Major Risk Factors Your Blood Pressure Crunching the Numbers Your blood pressure category is determined by the higher number of either your systolic or your diastolic measurement For example if your systolic number is 115 but your diastolicnumber is 85 your category is prehypertension Systolic Diastolic Normal blood pressure Less than and Less than 120 mm Hg 80 mm Hg Prehypertension 120 139 or 80 89 mm Hg mm Hg High blood pressure 140 mm Hg or 90 mm Hg or higher or higher Blood Pressure

14 Understanding Risk It s important to understand what each of these categories means High blood pressure of course increases heart disease risk morethan any other category But many people don t realize that the second category prehypertension also increases your risk of heartattack stroke and heart failure To the extent possible everyoneshould aim for normal blood pressure levels Be aware too that a high systolic blood pressure level first number is dangerous If your systolic blood pressure is 140 mm Hg or high er you are more likely to develop cardiovascular and kidney diseaseseven if your diastolic blood pressure second number is in the normal range After age 50 people are more likely to develop highsystolic blood pressure High systolic blood pressure is high bloodpressure If you have this condition you will need to take steps tocontrol it High blood pressure can be controlled in two ways bychanging your lifestyle and by taking medication Changing Your Lifestyle If your blood pressure is not too high you may be able to control it entirely by losing weight if you are overweight getting regularphysical activity cutting down on alcohol and changing your eatinghabits A special eating plan called D AS H can help you lower yourblood pressure D AS H stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension The D AS H eating plan emphasizes fruits vegeta bles whole grain foods and low fat or fat free milk and milk products It is rich in magnesium potassium and calcium as well as proteinand fiber It is low in saturated and total fat and cholesterol andlimits red meat sweets and beverages with added sugars If you follow the D AS H eating plan and also consume less sodium you are likely to reduce your blood pressure even more Sodium is asubstance that affects blood pressure It is the main ingredient insalt and is found in many processed foods such as soups conven ience meals some breads and cereals and salted snacks For more on the D AS H eating plan and other changes you can make to lower and prevent high blood pressure see the Taking Charge section of this guidebook pages 45 82 Your Guide to a Healthy Heart

4 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep What Is Sleep Sleep was long considered just a block of time when your brain and body shut down Thanks to sleep research studies done over the past several decades it is now known that sleep has distinct stages that cycle throughout the night in predictable patterns How well rested you are and how well you function depend not just on your total sleep time but on how much sleep you get each night and the timing of your sleep stages Your brain and body functions stay active through out sleep and each stage of sleep is linked to a specific type of brain waves distinctive patterns of electrical activity in the brain Sleep is divided into two basic types rapid eye movement R EM sleep and non R EM sleep with three different stages For more information see Types of Sleep on page 5 Typically sleep begins with non R EM sleep In stage 1 non R EM sleep you sleep lightly and can be awakened easily by noises or other disturbances During this first stage of sleep your eyes move slowly your muscles relax and your heart and breath ing rates begin to slow You then enter stage 2 non R EM sleep which is defined by slower brain waves with occasional bursts of rapid waves You spend about half the night in this stage When you progress into stage 3 non R EM sleep your brain waves become even slower and the brain produces extremely slow waves almost exclusively called Delta waves

5 l l l l l Stage 3 is a very deep stage of sleep during which it is very difficult to be awakened Children who wet the bed or sleep walk tend to do so during stage 3 of non R EM sleep Deep sleep is considered the restorative stage of sleep that is necessary for feeling well rested and energetic during the day Types of Sleep Non R EM Sleep R EM Sleep Stage 1 Light sleep easily awakened muscles relax with occasional twitches eye movements are slow Stage 2 Eye movements stop slower brain waves with occasional bursts of rapid brain waves Stage 3 Occurs soon after you fall asleep and mostly in the first half of the night Deep sleep difficult to awaken large slow brain waves heart and respiratory rates are slow and muscles are relaxed Usually first occurs about 90 minutes after you fall asleep and longer deeper periods occur during the second half of the night cycles along with the non R EM stages throughout the night Eyes move rapidly behind closed eyelids Breathing heart rate and blood pressure ar e irregular Dr eaming occurs Arm and leg muscles are temporarily paralyzed Types of Sleep During R EM sleep your eyes move rapidly in different directions even though your eyelids stay closed Your breathing also becomes more rapid irregular and shallow and your heart rate and blood pressure increase Dreaming typically occurs during R EM sleep During this type of sleep your arm and leg muscles are temporarily paralyzed so that you cannot act out any dreams that you may be having What Is Sleep

6 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep You typically first enter R EM sleep about an hour to an hour and a half after falling asleep After that the sleep stages repeat them selves continuously while you sleep As you sleep R EM sleep time becomes longer while time spent in stage 3 non R EM sleep becomes shorter By the time you wake up nearly all your sleep time has been spent in stages 1 and 2 of non R EM sleep and in R EM sleep If R EM sleep is severely disrupted during one night R EM sleep time is typically longer than normal in subsequent nights until you catch up Overall almost one half of your total sleep time is spent in stage 2 non R EM sleep and about one fifth each in deep sleep stage 3 of non R EM sleep and R EM sleep In contrast infants spend half or more of their total sleep time in R EM sleep Gradually as they grow the percentage of total sleep time they spend in R EM contin ues to decrease until it reaches the one fifth level typical of later childhood and adulthood Why people dream and why R EM sleep is so important are not well understood It is known that R EM sleep stimulates the brain regions you use to learn and make memories Animal studies suggest that dreams may reflect the brain s sorting and selectively storing new information acquired during wake time While this information is processed the brain might revisit scenes from the day and mix them randomly Dreams are generally recalled when we wake briefly or are awakened by an alarm clock or some other noise in the environment Studies show however that other stages of sleep besides R EM also are needed to form the pathways in the brain that enable us to learn and remember

7 What Makes You Sleep Although you may put off going to sleep in order to squeeze more activities into your day eventually your need for sleep becomes overwhelming This need appears to be due in part to two sub stances your body produces One substance called adenosine builds up in your blood while you re awake Then while you sleep your body breaks down the adenosine Levels of this substance in your body may help trigger sleep when needed A buildup of adenosine and many other complex factors might explain why after several nights of less than optimal amounts of sleep you build up a sleep debt This may cause you to sleep longer than normal or at unplanned times during the day Because of your body s internal processes you can t adapt to getting less sleep than your body needs Eventually a lack of sleep catches up with you The other substance that helps make you sleep is a hormone called melatonin This hormone makes you naturally feel sleepy at night It is part of your internal biological clock which controls when you feel sleepy and your sleep patterns Your biological clock is a small bundle of cells in your brain that works throughout the day and night Internal and external environmental cues such as light signals received through your eyes control these cells Your biologi cal clock triggers your body to produce melatonin which helps prepare your brain and body for sleep As melatonin is released you ll feel increasingly drowsy Because of your biological clock you naturally feel the most tired between midnight and 7 a m You also may feel mildly sleepy in the afternoon between 1 p m and 4 p m when another increase in melatonin occurs in your body Your biological clock makes you the most alert during daylight hours and the least alert during the early morning hours Conse quently most people do their best work during the day Our 24 7 society however demands that some people work at night Nearly one quarter of all workers work shifts that are not during the daytime and more than two thirds of these workers have problem sleepiness and or difficulty sleeping Because their work schedules What Makes You Sleep

8 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep are at odds with powerful sleep regulating cues like sunlight night shift workers often find themselves drowsy at work and they have difficulty falling or staying asleep during the daylight hours when their work schedules require them to sleep The fatigue experienced by night shift workers can be dangerous Major industrial accidents such as the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl nuclear power plant accidents and the Exxon Valdez oil spill have been caused in part by mistakes made by overly tired workers on the night shift or an extended shift Night shift workers also are at greater risk of being in car crashes when they drive home from work during the early morning hours because the biological clock is not sending out an alerting signal One study found that one fifth of night shift workers had a car crash or a near miss in the preceding year because of sleepiness on the drive home from work Night shift workers are also more likely to have physical problems such as heart disease digestive troubles and infertility as well as emotional problems All of these problems may be related at least in part to the workers chronic sleepiness possi bly because their biological clocks are not in tune with their work schedules See Working the Night Shift on page 9 for some helpful tips if you work a night shift Other factors also can influence your need for sleep including your immune system s production of hormones called cytokines Cyto kines are made to help the immune system fight certain infections or chronic inflammation and may prompt you to sleep more than usual The extra sleep may help you conserve the resources needed to fight the infection Recent studies confirm that being well rested improves the body s responses to infection People are creatures of habit and one of the hardest habits to break is the natural wake and sleep cycle Together a number of physiological factors help you sleep and wake up at the same times each day

9 Consequently you may have a hard time adjusting when you travel across time zones The light cues outside and the clocks in your new location may tell you it is 8 a m and you should be active but your body is telling you it is more like 4 a m and you should sleep The end result is jet lag sleepiness during the day difficulty falling or staying asleep at night poor concentration confusion nausea and generally feeling unwell and irritable See Dealing With Jet Lag on page 10 Working the Night Shift Try to limit night shift work if that is possible If you must work the night shift the following tips may help you l l l l l Increase your total amount of sleep by adding naps and lengthening the amount of time you allot for sleep Use bright lights in your workplace Minimize the number of shift changes so that your body s biological clock has a longer time to adjust to a nighttime work schedule Get rid of sound and light distractions in your bedroom during your daytime sleep Use caffeine only during the first part of your shift to promote alertness at night If you are unable to fall asleep during the day and all else fails talk with your doctor to see whether it would be wise for you to use prescribed short acting sleeping pills to help you sleep during the day Night Shift What Makes You Sleep

10 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep Dealing With Jet Lag Be aware that adjusting to a new time zone may take several days If you are going to be away for just a few days it may be better to stick to your original sleep and wake times as much as possible rather than adjusting your biological clock too many times in rapid succession Eastward travel generally causes more severe jet lag than westward travel because traveling east requires you to shorten the day and your biological clock is better able to adjust to a longer day than a shorter day Fortunately for globetrotters a few preventive measures and adjustments seem to help some people relieve jet lag particularly when they are going to spend more than a few days at their destination l l Adjust your biological clock During the 2 3 days prior to a long trip get adequate sleep You can make minor changes to your sleep schedule For example if you are traveling west delay your bed time and wake time progr essively by 20 to 30 minute intervals If you are traveling east advance your wake time by 10 to 15 minutes a day for a few days and try to advance your bed time Decreasing light exposure at bedtime and increasing light exposure at wake time can help you make these adjustments When you arrive at your destination spend a lot of time outdoors so your body gets the light cues it needs to adjust to the new time zone Take a couple of short 10 15 minute catnaps if you feel tired but do not take long naps during the day Avoid alcohol and caffeine Although it may be tempting to drink alcohol to relieve the stress of travel and make it easier to fall asleep you re more likely to sleep lighter and wake up in the middle of the night when the ef fects of the alcohol wear off Caffeine can help keep you awake longer but caffeine also can make it harder for you to fall asleep if its effects haven t worn off by the time you are ready to go to bed Therefore it s best to use caffeine only during the morning and not during the afternoon

11 l What about melatonin Your body produces this hormone that may cause some drowsiness and cues the brain and body that it is time to fall asleep Melatonin builds up in your body during the early evening and into the first 2 hours of your sleep period and then its r elease stops in the middle of the night Melatonin is available as an over the counter supplement Because melatonin is considered safe when used over a period of days or weeks and seems to help people feel sleepy it has been suggested as a treatment for jet lag But melatonin s effectiveness is controversial and its safety when used over a prolonged period is unclear Some studies find that taking melatonin supplements before bedtime for several days after arrival in a new time zone can make it easier to fall asleep at the proper time Other studies find that melatonin does not help relieve jet lag What Makes You Sleep Jet Lag

12 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep What Does Sleep Do for You A number of aspects of your health and quality of life are linked to sleep and these aspects are impaired when you are sleep deprived Your Learning Memory and Mood Students who have trouble grasping new information or learning new skills are often advised to sleep on it and that advice seems well founded Recent studies reveal that people can learn a task better if they are well rested They also can better remember what they learned if they get a good night s sleep after learning the task than if they are sleep deprived Study volunteers had to sleep at least 6 hours to show improvement in learning Additionally the amount of improvement was directly related to how much time they slept for example volunteers who slept 8 hours outperformed those who slept only 6 or 7 hours Other studies suggest that it s important to get enough rest the night before a mentally challenging task rather than only sleeping for a short period or waiting to sleep until after the task is complete Many well known artists and scientists claim to have had creative insights while they slept Mary Shelley for example said the idea for her novel Frankenstein came to her in a dream Although it has not been shown that dreaming is the driving force behind innova tion one study suggests that sleep is needed for creative problem solving In that study volunteers were asked to perform a memory task and then were tested on it 8 hours later Those who were allowed to sleep for 8 hours immediately after trying the task and before being tested were much more likely to find a creative way of simplifying the task and improving their performance compared with those who were awake the entire 8 hours before being tested Exactly what happens during sleep to improve our learning memo ry and insight isn t known Experts suspect however that while

13 people sleep they form or strengthen the pathways of brain cells needed to perform these tasks This process may explain why sleep is needed for proper brain development in infants Not only is a good night s sleep required to form new learning and memory pathways in the brain but also sleep is necessary for those pathways to work well Several studies show that lack of sleep causes thinking processes to slow down Lack of sleep also makes it harder to focus and pay attention Lack of sleep can make you more easily confused Studies also find that a lack of sleep leads to faulty decisionmaking and more risk taking A lack of sleep slows down your reaction time which is particularly important to driving and other tasks that require quick response When people who lack sleep are tested on a driving simulator they perform just as poorly as people who are drunk See Crash in Bed Not on the Road on page 16 The bottom line is Not getting a good night s sleep can be dangerous Even if you don t have a mentally or physically challenging day ahead of you you should still get enough sleep to put yourself in a good mood Most people report being irritable if not downright unhappy when they lack sleep People who chronically suffer from a lack of sleep either because they do not spend enough time in bed or because they have an untreated sleep disorder are at greater risk of developing depression One group of people who usually don t get enough sleep is mothers of newborns Some experts think depression after childbirth postpar tum blues is caused in part by a lack of sleep Your Heart Sleep gives your heart and vascular system a much needed rest During non R EM sleep your heart rate and blood pressure progressively slow as you enter deeper sleep During R EM sleep in response to dreams your heart What Does Sleep Do for You

14 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep and breathing rates can rise and fall and your blood pressure can be variable These changes throughout the night in blood pressure and heart and breathing rates seem to promote cardiovascular health If you don t get enough sleep the nightly dip in blood pressure that appears to be important for good cardiovascular health may not occur Failure to experience the normal dip in blood pressure during sleep can be related to insufficient sleep time an untreated sleep disorder for example sleep apnea or other factors Some sleep related abnormalities may be markers of heart disease and increased risk of stroke A lack of sleep also puts your body under stress and may trigger the release of more adrenaline cortisol and other stress hormones during the day These hormones keep your blood pressure from dipping during sleep which increases your risk for heart disease Lack of sleep also may trigger your body to produce more of certain proteins thought to play a role in heart disease For example some studies find that people who repeatedly don t get enough sleep have higher than normal blood levels of C reactive protein a sign of inflammation High levels of this protein may indicate an increased risk for a condition called atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries Your Hormones When you were young your mother may have told you that you need to get enough sleep to grow strong and tall She may have been right Deep sleep stage 3 non R EM sleep triggers more release of growth hormone which contributes to growth in children and boosts muscle mass and the repair of cells and tissues in children and adults Sleep s effect on the release of sex hormones also contributes to puberty and fertility Consequently women who work at night and tend to lack sleep may be at increased risk of miscarriage Your mother also probably was right if she told you that getting a good night s sleep on a regular basis would help keep you from getting sick and help you get better if you do get sick During sleep your body creates more cytokines cellular hormones that help the immune system fight various infections Lack of sleep can reduce your body s ability to fight off common infections Research also reveals that a lack of sleep can reduce the body s response to the flu

15 vaccine For example sleep deprived volunteers given the flu vaccine produced less than half as many flu antibodies as those who were well rested and given the same vaccine Although lack of exercise and other factors also contribute the current epidemic of diabetes and obesity seems to be related at least in part to chronically short or disrupted sleep or not sleeping during the night Evidence is growing that sleep is a powerful regulator of appetite energy use and weight control During sleep the body s production of the appetite suppressor leptin increases and the appetite stimulant grehlin decreases Studies find that the less people sleep the more likely they are to be overweight or obese and prefer eating foods that are higher in calories and carbohydrates People who report an average total sleep time of 5 hours a night for example are much more likely to become obese compared with people who sleep 7 8 hours a night A number of hormones released during sleep also control the body s use of energy A distinct rise and fall of blood sugar levels during sleep appears to be linked to sleep stages Not sleeping at the right time not getting enough sleep overall or not enough of each stage of sleep disrupts this pattern One study found that when healthy young men slept only 4 hours a night for 6 nights in a row their insulin and blood sugar levels matched those seen in people who were developing diabetes Another study found that women who slept less than 7 hours a night were more likely to develop diabetes over time than those who slept between 7 and 8 hours a night What Does Sleep Do for You

16 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep Crash in Bed Not on the Road Most people are aware of the hazards of drunk driving But driving while sleepy can be just as dangerous Indeed crashes due to sleepy drivers are as deadly as those due to drivers impaired by alcohol And you don t have to be asleep at the wheel to put yourself and others in danger Both alcohol and a lack of sleep limit your ability to react quickly to a suddenly braking car a sharp curve in the road or other situations that require rapid responses Just a few seconds delay in reaction time can be a life or death matter when driving When people who lack sleep are tested on a driving simulator they perform as badly as or worse than those who are drunk The combination of alcohol and lack of sleep can be especially dangerous There is increasing evidence that sleep deprivation and inexperience behind the wheel both particularly common in adolescents is a lethal combination Of course driving is also hazardous if you fall asleep at the wheel which happens surprisingly often One quarter of the drivers surveyed in New York State reported they had fallen asleep at the wheel at some time Often people briefly nod off at the wheel without being aware of it they just can t recall what happened over the previous few seconds or longer And people who lack sleep are more apt to take risks and make poor judgments which also can boost their chances of getting in a car crash Opening a window or turning up the radio won t help you stay awake while driving The bottom line is that there is no substitute for sleep Be aware of these warning signs that you are too sleepy to drive safely trouble keeping your eyes open or focused continual yawning or being unable to recall driving the past few miles Remember if you are short on sleep stay out of the driver s seat

17 Here are some potentially life saving tips for avoiding drowsy driving l l l l l l Be well rested before hitting the road If you have several nights in a r ow of fewer than 7 8 hours of sleep your reaction time slows Restoring that reaction time to normal can take more than one night of good sleep because a sleep debt accumulates after each night you lose sleep It may take several nights of being well rested to repay that sleep debt and make you ready for driving on a long road trip Avoid driving between midnight and 7 a m Unless you are accustomed to being awake then this period of time is when we are naturally the least alert and most tir ed Don t drive alone A companion who can keep you engaged in conversation might help you stay awake while driving Schedule frequent breaks on long road trips If you feel sleepy while driving pull of f the road and take a nap for 15 20 minutes Don t drink alcohol Just one beer when you are sleep deprived will affect you as much as two or three beers when you ar e well rested Don t count on caffeine or other tricks Although drinking a cola or a cup of coffee might help keep you awake for a short time it won t over come extreme sleepiness or relieve a sleep debt What Does Sleep Do for You

19 How Much Sleep Is Enough Animal studies suggest that sleep is as vital as food for survival Rats for example normally live 2 3 years but they live only 5 weeks if they are deprived of R EM sleep and only 2 3 weeks if they are deprived of all sleep stages a timeframe similar to death due to starvation But how much sleep do humans need To help answer that question scientists look at how much people sleep when unrestricted the average amount of sleep among various age groups and the amount of sleep that studies reveal is necessary to function at your best When healthy adults are given unlimited opportunity to sleep they sleep on average between 8 and 8 5 hours a night But sleep needs vary from person to person Some people appear to need only about 7 hours to avoid problem sleepiness whereas others need 9 or more hours of sleep Sleep needs also change throughout the life cycle Newborns sleep between 16 and 18 hours a day and children in preschool sleep between 11 and 12 hours a day School aged children and adolescents need at least 10 hours of sleep each night The hormonal influences of puberty tend to shift adolescents biologi cal clocks As a result teenagers who need between 9 and 10 hours of sleep a night are more likely to go to bed later than younger children and adults and they tend to want to sleep later in the morning This delayed sleep wake rhythm conflicts with the early morning start times of many high schools and helps explain why most teenagers get an average of only 7 7 5 hours of sleep a night As people get older the pattern of sleep also changes especially the amount of time spent in deep sleep This explains why children can sleep through loud noises and why they might not wake up when moved Across the lifespan the sleep period tends to advance namely relative to teenagers older adults tend to go to bed earlier and wake earlier The quality but not necessarily the quantity of How Much Sleep Is Enough

20 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep deep non R EM sleep also changes with a trend toward lighter sleep The relative percentages of stages of sleep appear to stay mostly constant after infancy From midlife through late life people awaken more throughout the night These sleep disruptions cause older people to lose more and more of stages 1 and 2 non R EM sleep as well as R EM sleep Some older people complain of difficulty falling asleep early morning awakenings frequent and long awakenings during the night daytime sleepiness and a lack of refreshing sleep Many sleep problems however are not a natural part of sleep in the elderly Their sleep complaints may be due in part to medical conditions illnesses or medications they are taking all of which can disrupt sleep In fact one study found that the prevalence of sleep problems is very low in healthy older adults Other causes of some of older adults sleep complaints are sleep apnea restless legs syndrome and other sleep disorders that become more common with age Also older people are more likely to have their sleep disrupted by the need to urinate during the night Some evidence shows that the biological clock shifts in older people so they are more apt to go to sleep earlier at night and wake up earlier in the morning No evidence indicates that older people can get by with less sleep than younger people See Top 10 Sleep Myths on page 22 Poor sleep in older people may result in excessive daytime sleepiness attention and memory problems depressed mood and overuse of sleeping pills Despite variations in sleep quantity and quality both related to age and

21 between individuals studies suggest that the optimal amount of sleep needed to perform adequately avoid a sleep debt and not have problem sleepiness during the day is about 7 8 hours for adults and at least 10 hours for school aged children and adolescents Similar amounts seem to be necessary to avoid an increased risk of develop ing obesity diabetes or cardiovascular diseases Quality of sleep and the timing of sleep are as important as quantity People whose sleep is frequently interrupted or cut short may not get enough of both non R EM sleep and R EM sleep Both types of sleep appear to be crucial for learning and memory and perhaps for the restorative benefits of healthy sleep including the growth and repair of cells Many people try to make up for lost sleep during the week by sleeping more on the weekends But if you have lost too much sleep sleeping in on a weekend does not completely erase your sleep debt Certainly sleeping more at the end of a week won t make up for any poor performance you had earlier in that week Just one night of inadequate sleep can negatively affect your functioning and mood during at least the next day Daytime naps are another strategy some people use to make up for lost sleep during the night Some evidence shows that short naps up to an hour can make up at least partially for the sleep missed on the previous night and improve alertness mood and work performance But naps don t substitute for a good night s sleep One study found that a daytime nap after a lack of sleep at night did not fully restore levels of blood sugar to the pattern seen with adequate nighttime sleep If a nap lasts longer than 20 minutes you may have a hard time waking up fully In addition late afternoon naps can make falling asleep at night more difficult How Much Sleep Is Enough

22 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep Top 10 Sleep Myths Myth 1 Sleep is a time when your body and brain shut down for rest and relaxation No evidence shows that any major organ including the brain or regulatory system in the body shuts down during sleep Some physiological processes actually become more active while you sleep For example secretion of certain hormones is boosted and activity of the pathways in the brain linked to learning and memory increases Myth 2 Getting just 1 hour less sleep per night than needed will not have any effect on your daytime functioning This lack of sleep may not make you noticeably sleepy during the day But even slightly less sleep can affect your ability to think properly and respond quickly and it can impair your cardiovascular health and energy balance as well as your body s ability to fight infections particularly if lack of sleep continues If you consistently do not get enough sleep a sleep debt builds up that you can never repay This sleep debt affects your health and quality of life and makes you feel tired during the day Myth 3 Your body adjusts quickly to different sleep schedules Your biological clock makes you most alert during the daytime and least alert at night Thus even if you work the night shift you will naturally feel sleepy when nighttime comes Most people can reset their biological clock but only by appropriately timed cues and even then by 1 2 hours per day at best Consequently it can take more than a week to adjust to a substantial change in your sleep wake cycle for example when traveling across several time zones or switching from working the day shift to the night shift Myth 4 People need less sleep as they get older Older people don t need less sleep but they may get less sleep or find their sleep less refreshing That s because as people age the quality of their sleep changes Older people are also more likely to have insomnia or other medical conditions that disrupt their sleep

23 Myth 5 Extra sleep for one night can cure you of problems with excessive daytime fatigue Not only is the quantity of sleep important but also the quality of sleep Some people sleep 8 or 9 hours a night but don t feel well rested when they wake up because the quality of their sleep is poor A number of sleep disorders and other medical conditions affect the quality of sleep Sleeping more won t lessen the daytime sleepiness these disorders or conditions cause However many of these disorders or conditions can be treated effectively with changes in behavior or with medical therapies Additionally one night of increased sleep may not correct multiple nights of inadequate sleep Myth 6 You can make up for lost sleep during the week by sleeping more on the weekends Although this sleeping pattern will help you feel more rested it will not completely make up for the lack of sleep or correct your sleep debt This pattern also will not necessarily make up for impaired performance during the week or the physical problems that can result from not sleeping enough Furthermore sleeping later on the weekends can affect your biological clock making it much harder to go to sleep at the right time on Sunday nights and get up early on Monday mornings Myth 7 Naps are a waste of time Although naps are no substitute for a good night s sleep they can be restorative and help counter some of the effects of not getting enough sleep at night Naps can actually help you learn how to do certain tasks quicker But avoid taking naps later than 3 p m particularly if you have trouble falling asleep at night as late naps can make it harder for you to fall asleep when you go to bed Also limit your naps to no longer than 20 minutes because longer naps will make it harder to wake up and How Much Sleep Is Enough

41 n n n n Like adults who have sleep apnea children who have this disorder usually snore loudly snort or gasp and have brief pauses in breath ing while sleeping Small children often have enlarged tonsils and adenoids that increase their risk for sleep apnea But doctors may not suspect sleep apnea in children because instead of showing the typical signs of sleepiness during the day these children often become agitated and may be considered hyperactive The effects of sleep apnea in children may include poor school performance and difficult aggressive behavior A number of factors can make a person susceptible to sleep apnea These factors include n n n n n n Throat muscles and tongue that relax more than normal while asleep Enlarged tonsils and adenoids Being overweight the excess fat tissue around your neck makes it harder to keep the throat area open Head and neck shape that creates a somewhat smaller airway size in the mouth and throat area Congestion due to allergies that also can narrow the airway Family history of sleep apnea If your doctor suspects that you have sleep apnea you may be referred to a sleep specialist Some of the ways to help diagnose sleep apnea include A medical history that includes asking you and your family questions about how you sleep and how you function during the day Checking your mouth nose and throat for extra or large tissues for example checking the tonsils uvula the tissue that hangs from the middle of the back of the mouth and soft palate the roof of your mouth in the back of your throat An overnight recording of what happens with your breathing during sleep polysomnogram or P SG A multiple sleep latency test M SL T usually done in a sleep center to see how quickly you fall asleep at times when you would normally be awake Falling asleep in only a few minutes usually means that you are very sleepy during the day Being very sleepy during the day can be a sign of sleep apnea Common Sleep Disorders

43 My doctor prescribed C PA P continuous positive airway pressure for me but it was not easy to use at first Sleeping with a C PA P machine was uncomfortable for me so I didn t use it like I should have rarely if at all One day at work I started feeling really bad so I went to the hospital The doctors told me that since I had not been using C PA P regularly not enough oxygen was going to my brain which caused symptoms like those for a stroke So I went back to my doctor and got a different C PA P machine that was more comfortable for me It s important to talk with your health care provider to make sure that your treatment is comfortable and works for you J IM Another treatment approach that may help some people is the use of a mouthpiece oral or dental appliance If you have mild sleep apnea or do not have sleep apnea but snore very loudly your doctor or dentist also may recommend this A custom fitted plastic mouth piece will be made by a dentist or an orthodontist a specialist in correcting teeth or jaw problems The mouthpiece will adjust your lower jaw and tongue to help keep the airway in your throat more open while you are sleeping Air can then flow more easily into your lungs because there is less resistance to breathing Following up with the dentist or orthodontist is important to correct any side effects and to be sure that your mouthpiece continues to fit properly It is also important to have a followup sleep study to see whether your sleep apnea has improved Some people who have sleep apnea may benefit from surgery this depends on the findings of the evaluation by the sleep specialist Removing tonsils and adenoids that are blocking the airway is done frequently especially in children Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty U PP P is a surgery for adults that removes the tonsils uvula and part of the soft palate Tracheostomy is a surgery used rarely and only in severe sleep apnea when no other treatments have been successful A small hole is made in the windpipe and a tube is inserted Air will flow through the tube and into the lungs bypass ing the obstruction in the upper airway Common Sleep Disorders

44 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep l l l How Are Sleep disorders diagnosed Depending on your symptoms your doctor will gather informa tion and consider several possible tests when trying to diagnose a sleep disorder Sleep history and sleep log Your doctor will ask you how many hours you sleep each night how often you awaken during the night and for how long how long it takes you to fall asleep how well rested you feel upon awakening and how sleepy you feel during the day Y our doctor may ask you to keep a sleep diary for a few weeks See Sample Sleep Diary on page 54 Your doctor also may ask you whether you have any symptoms of sleep apnea or restless legs syndr ome such as loud snoring snorting or gasping morning headaches tingling or unpleasant sensations in the limbs that are relieved by moving them and jerking of the limbs during sleep Your sleeping partner may be asked whether you have some of these symptoms as you may not be aware of them yourself Sleep recording in a sleep laboratory polysomnogram A sleep recording or polysomnogram P SG is usually done while you stay overnight at a sleep center or sleep laboratory Electrodes and other monitors are placed on your scalp face chest limbs and finger While you sleep these devices measur e your brain activity eye movements muscle activity heart rate and rhythm blood pressure and how much air moves in and out of your lungs This test also checks the amount of oxygen in your blood A P SG test is painless In certain circumstances the P SG can be done at home A home monitor can be used to record heart rate how air moves in and out of your lungs the amount of oxygen in your blood and your breathing effort Multiple sleep latency test M SL T This daytime sleep study measures how sleepy you are and is particularly useful for diagnosing narcolepsy The M SL T is conducted in a sleep

45 laboratory and typically done after an overnight sleep recording P SG In this test monitoring devices for sleep stage are placed on your scalp and face You are asked to nap four or five times for 20 minutes every 2 hours during the day Technicians note how quickly you fall asleep and how long it takes you to reach various stages of sleep especially R EM sleep during your naps Normal individuals either do not fall asleep during these short designated naptimes or take a long time to fall asleep People who fall asleep in less than 5 minutes are likely to require treatment for a sleep disorder as are those who quickly reach R EM sleep during their naps It is important to have a sleep specialist interpret the results of your P SG or M SL T See How To Find a Sleep Center and Sleep Specialist on page 56 Common Sleep Disorders

51 Eventually researchers may develop a treatment for narcolepsy that restores hypocretin to normal levels In the meantime most people who have narcolepsy find some to all of their symptoms relieved by various drug treatments For example central nervous system stimulants can reduce daytime sleepiness Antidepressants and other drugs that suppress R EM sleep can prevent muscle weakness sleep paralysis and vivid dreaming Doctors also usually recommend that people who have narcolepsy take short naps 10 15 minutes two or three times a day if possible to help control excessive daytime sleepiness Parasomnias Abnormal Arousals In some people the walking talking and other body functions normally suppressed during sleep occur during certain sleep stages Alternatively the paralysis or vivid images usually experienced during dreaming may persist after awakening These occurrences are collectively known as parasomnias and include confusional arousals a mixed state of being both asleep and awake sleep talking sleep walking night terrors sleep paralysis and R EM sleep behavior disorder acting out dreams Most of these disorders such as confusional arousals sleep walking and night terrors are more common in children who tend to outgrow them once they become adults People who are sleep deprived also may experience some of these disorders including sleep walking and sleep paralysis Sleep paralysis also commonly occurs in people who have narco lepsy Certain medications or neurological disorders appear to lead to other parasomnias such as R EM sleep behavior disorder and these parasomnias tend to occur more in elderly people If you or a family member has persistent episodes of sleep paralysis sleep walking or acting out of dreams talk with your doctor Taking measures to assure the safety of children and other family members who have partial arousals from sleep is very important Common Sleep Disorders

57 n n n n Research Researchers have learned a lot about sleep and sleep disorders in recent years That knowledge has led to a better understanding of the importance of sleep to our lives and our health Research supported by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute N HL BI has helped identify some of the causes of sleep disorders and their effects on the heart brain lungs and other body systems The N HL BI also supports ongoing research on the most effective ways to diagnose and treat sleep disorders Many questions remain about sleep and sleep disorders The N HL BI continues to support a range of research that focuses on Better understanding of how a lack of sleep increases the riskfor obesity diabetes heart disease and stroke New ways to diagnose sleep disorders Genetic environmental and social factors that lead to sleep disorders The adverse effects from a lack of sleep on body and brain Much of this research depends on the willingness of volunteers to participate in clinical research If you would like to help researchers advance science on sleep or about a sleep disorder you have and possible treatments talk to your doctor about participating in clinical research For more information see Clinical Research on page 58 Research

58 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep Clinical research Researchers can learn quite a bit about sleep and sleep disorders by studying animals However to fully understand sleep and its affect on health and functioning as well as how best to diagnose and treat sleep disorders researchers need to do clinical research on people This type of research is called clinical research because it is often conducted in clinical settings such as hospitals or doctors offices The two types of clinical research are clinical trials and clinical studies l Clinical trials test new ways to diagnose prevent or treat various disorders For example treatments such as medicines medical devices surgery or other procedures for a disorder need to be tested in people who have the disorder A trial helps determine whether a treatment is safe and effective in humans before it is made available for public use In a clinical trial participants are randomly assigned to groups One group receives the new treatment being tested Other groups may receive a different treatment or a placebo an inactive substance resembling a drug being tested Comparing results from the groups gives researchers confidence that changes in the test group are due to the new treatment and not to other factors

59 l l l Other types of clinical studies are done to discover the factors including environmental behavioral or genetic factors that cause or worsen various disorders Researchers may follow a group of people over time to learn what factors contribute to becoming sick Clinical studies and trials may be relatively brief or may last for years and require many visits to the study sites These sites usually are university hospitals or research centers but they can include private doctors offices and community hospitals If you participate in clinical research the research will be explained to you in detail you will be given a chance to ask questions and you will be asked to provide written permission You may not directly benefit from the results of the clinical research you participate in but the information gathered will help others and will add to scientific knowledge Taking part in clinical research has other benefits as well You ll learn more about your disorder you ll have the support of a team of health care providers and your health will likely be monitored closely However participation also can have risks which you should discuss with your doctor No matter what you decide your regular medical care will not be affected If you re thinking about participating in a clinical study you may have questions about the purpose of the study the types of tests and treatment involved how participation will affect your daily life and whether any costs are involved Your doctor may be able to answer some of your questions and help you find clinical studies in which you can participate You also can visit the following Web sites to learn about being in a study and to search for clinical trials being done on your disorder www clinicaltrials gov www nhlbi nih gov studies index htm Clinical Research Research

vii Preface This book explains how to use a history examination and preliminary tests to arrive at a diagnosis This helps us as clinicians to anticipate what may happen next and how interventions may influence the disease process We are also better equipped to share with our patients and colleagues what we are thinking and doing The approach used here enables clinicians to focus on symptoms physical signs and initial test results that are likely to lead to a diagnosis This is based on the principle that diagnostic leads with short differential diagnoses will be more informative than those features with long lists of causes Each sign or symptom on a page is followed by a list of diagnoses with associated suggestive and confirmatory clinical and laboratory features The reader may scan down the page to see which entries are compatible with the patient s findings thus far The compatible findings can then be used as evidence for the diagnosis In the spirit of the Oxford American Handbooks readers are encour aged to be critical about the contents of the book to make changes and to let us know of any significant differences in opinion or errors G L H L

I MP OR TA NT Q UE ST IO NS A ND A NS WE RS xvi 9 How can the book be used as a learning tool When you read the book imagine that you have come across a patient with the finding s forming the title for that page Cover the differential diagnoses on the left hand side of the page with your hand or a book mark to see if you can predict the diagnosis from reading the findings on the right hand side of the page This is the direction in which your mind should be working when trying to think about diagnosis and solve diag nostic dilemmas You can then read the whole page for an overview You should always try to recall what you know already about something before reading about it in order to learn in an integrated way 10 Can a transparent diagnostic approach improve the diagnostic accuracy of an experienced physician It is a common experience that if we try to give a carefully reasoned justification for an intuitive opinion especially by writing it down we may find that we cannot justify it easily and will reconsider our opinion Conversely if our explicitly reasoned justification confirms our intuitive opinion then we will feel more confident in its success This is illustrated by what happened when data assembled by t he late Professor Tim de Dombal were analyzed The surgeon was correct in his intuitive diagnosis 235 300 78 3 of the time and a transparent logical approach using small combinations of findings was correct 230 300 76 6 of the time However the surgeon and transparent logical approach agreed about the diagnosis in 221 300 of cases When there was agreement in these 221 instances the diagnosis was correct in 200 221 90 5 of cases 1 11 How does this approach relate to diagnostic algorithms The suggestive and confirmatory evidence under each diagnosis represents the findings that would have been chosen by following the path down a diagnostic algorithm in order to arrive at the diagnosis However instead of locking the reader into a fixed sequence this book allows the reader to scan the different diagnoses and recognize which findings on the page best fit those of the patient In a sense each page provides a form of pattern recognition table The confirmatory evidence should be compatible with only one diagnosis 1 Llewelyn D EH 1988 Assessing the validity of diagnostic tests and clinical decisions M D thesis University of London

I MP OR TA NT Q UE ST IO NS A ND A NS WE RS xvii 12 How comprehensive is the information about each diagnosis There is not enough space in a handbook of this kind to describe all the combinations of evidence that might point to a diagnosis Therefore each page describes some of the differential diagnoses and for each of these an outline of typical findings that are suggestive and confirmatory This provides a start to which further information can be added by the reader in the Oxford Handbook spirit The diagnostic causes of a lead are usually listed in the order of their fre quency in those patients with the lead Sometimes they are grouped to gether because of causal similarity e g into cardiac causes and not in an order of frequency A major factor in determining this order is the preva lence of those with the diagnosis in the overall study population Therefore the order of the diagnoses on the page may vary between clinical settings Readers should try to insert the order number of the diagnostic causes in terms of probability in their own clinical settings 13 What is meant by facts opinions and evidence in the book Evidence is an account of real events that supports what we believe It is made up of facts Thus facts are also accounts of real events Real events are transient and immediately become memories that are easily forgotten or distorted Evidence is usually shared with others thus it must be recorded carefully using conventions that other people will also accept One of these conventions is that the record of a fact must bear a time and date so it can be corroborated e g by questioning other witnesses If such details are omitted this may arouse suspicion even if th ere is no need to seek corroboration In many cases a listener would judge the probability of corroboration or of replicating the finding to be high Most evidence takes the form of contemporaneous notes or printed numerical values from a measuring device In other cases a finding is pre served e g an X ray a photograph or a video recording with sound However all these methods are subject to error or some other distortion and the method of detection and recording has to follow appropriate conventions if they are to be accepted by others In this book evidence is described as being suggestive or confirmatory of a diagnosis and when it is applied to a real patient will have to bear a date or time Evidence about a single patient may be termed particular evidence whereas evidence about a group of patients may be termed general evidence The principle of replication also applies to general evidence For example 1 77 1 3 of normotensive diabetic patients taking placebo with an albumin excretion rate A ER starting between 20 and 40 g minute had nephropathy within 2 years 1 This would be general scientific evidence

I MP OR TA NT Q UE ST IO NS A ND A NS WE RS xviii If we took the pile of 77 records from the study we could simulate repeat studies by selecting a set of notes at random from the pile exam ining it returning it and doing this 77 times If a large number of such simulated studies were done then from the binomial distribution there would be a 99 7 chance of finding nephropathy in 0 77 or 1 77 or 2 77 or 3 77 or 4 77 of patients with a controlled B P in different simulated studies i e from 0 0 77 to 5 2 4 77 There is thus a 99 7 chance of replicating the finding of 1 77 by a repeat result being between 0 77 and 4 77 inclusive By comparison the standard 95 confidence interval for 1 77 is 0 03 to 7 02 and the 99 confidence interval for 1 77 is 0 01 to 9 37 However the probability of replication between two limits is more simi lar to the percentage confidence interval if the numbers in the study are high and the observed result is near to 50 A fact is an account of an observation but an opinion is a prediction about something that has not yet or even cannot be seen If an opinion can be checked by observation it can be founded on evidence it is substantiable If it can never be observed it cannot be founded on evi dence it is unsubstantiable An opinion can thus be substantiated if it can be based on past evidence For example if an individual patient s A ER is between 20 and 40 g minute then an opinion that such a diabetic patient with a controlled B P is unlikely to develop nephropathy would be well founded or substan tiated by the fact that of 77 such past patients only 1 went on to get nephropathy in a particular study 14 How do these ideas relate to statistical and other models of diagnosis Statistical and other mathematical methods many based on Bayes theorem generate a value much like a diagnostic test These may be calculated estimates of some biological value e g a calculated glomerular filtration rate a diagnostic score or an estimated probability All these numerical outputs of a calculation can be treated in the same way as direct meas urements by calibrating them against the frequency of some outcome e g the proportion who progress to requiring dialysis within 2 years see Fig 2 3 The numerical outputs could then be incorporated into the suggestive or confirmatory evidence for the diagnosis 1 Llewelyn D EH Garcia Puig J 2004 How different urinary albumin excretion rates can predict progression to nephropathy and the effect of treatment in hypertensive diab etics J Renin Angio tensin Aldosterone Syst 5 141 145

C HA PT ER 1 The diagnostic process 2 Introduction On the eve of clinical clerkships at the end of basic science training the medical student has mastered more information than he or she will ever again know in a lifetime Yet it is precisely at this time that developing the clinical scenario is most awkward Simply put the problem is one of incompatibility of two sets of knowledge Medical knowledge comprises millions of facts It must be organized by disease state and by pathophysiology Information is easily retrieved once mastered if organized by disease state or pathogenesis Clinical information obtained from a single patient during the interview and exam similarly comprises hundreds if not thousands of facts The patient however rarely presents as a disease More commonly the patient presents as a loosely constructed chain of complaints each further from the chief complaint and each of uncertain relation to the other A patient may present with a chief complaint accompanied by an elaborate psychological construct to prevent disclosure of painful events Occasionally the patient presents with a chief complaint accompanied by a distressingly detailed essay on bodily functions and their manifestations in each of the special senses It is the clinician s job to manage the information obtained during the interview in such a way that the patient s problem is accurately assessed The difficulty lies in the fact that the vast medical information the student commands is not in an accessible format during the clinical situation To a certain extent medical information must be relearned in a clinical format such as clinical presentations In other words the polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin into a gelatinous network that contorts the other wise supple red cell into an unyielding and obstructive mass can present as fever and shortness of breath in an African American man sickle chest syndrome Relearning the body of information mastered in medical school as presentations is neither efficient nor in most cases necessary Fortunately there are techniques that enable the budding clinician to make the two bodies of knowledge the medical information and the patient data compatible These techniques are simply thought proc esses They aren t unique to medicine but they comprise much of the fabric of clinical experience Paradoxically many seasoned clinicians cannot explain such thought processes well They are second nature like riding a bike or driving a car only the skills involved pertain to cognition rather than movement Students generally learn them by trial and error by emulation of their instructors and simply as a product of experience

D EV EL OP IN G A D IF FE RE NT IA L D IA GN OS IS 1 3 Developing a differential diagnosis There are two different thought processes involved in the diagnostic and clinical decision making process The first is the process of arriving at the diagnosis and the second is explaining and checking the diagnosis It is very important to recognize this difference The process of discovering the diagnosis is performed in a systematic way but the urgency of the situation or disruptive events may frequently result in the planned sequence being abandoned Diagnoses are arrived at in the form of imagined processes with dif ferent degrees of certainty These diagnoses some tentative others more certain will suggest relevant tests to clarify the situation and treatments to try and reverse or divert the course of the diagnoses This first thought process depends on the individual diagnostician s imagination combined with different types of thought processes ranging from rapid pattern recognition for familiar issues to a more tentative approach when in unfamiliar territory Students will almost always be in unfamiliar territory at first and no doctor can become familiar with every situation Doctors who see many patients will come across unfamiliar problems more often making medi cal practice a constant challenge and highlighting the need for a more methodical checking process

C HA PT ER 1 The diagnostic process 4 Problem solving skills Information processing is a primary goal of the physician patient interaction It proceeds in three phases data processing hypothesis generation and creation of a differential diagnosis The division between these phases is somewhat artificial but it is practical Data processing Immediately after the patient encounter and possibly after reviewing some basic labs and radiographic studies an accounting of all positive and negative findings takes place During this phase the clinician undertakes the process of collecting and examining all the findings or data and analyzing them to look for a common relationship between them By trying to fit these findings together to make a more accurate hypothesis the top or most likely diagnoses will emerge from this process Toward that end a positive finding is an abnormal finding in the patient a negative finding is either a normal finding that was expected to be abnormal or the absence of a positive finding that was expected to be present During early attempts at this type of data analysis we suggest that you create a table to help you master this process First make a list of all positive and negative findings This step involves the following Listing all positive and negative symptoms Listing all positive and negative physical findings Listing all positive and negative laboratory findings For example a positive finding in a patient with chest pain is that the pain is closely associated with exertion and relieved with rest A negative finding in such a patient would be the absence of relief of the pain with nitroglycerin because one would expect such a response with chest pain from coronary artery disease Data processing is also the first step in generation of a problem list Also consider each of the following attributes of findings Assessment of relevance to the chief complaint Each finding is exam ined for its relevance by classifying it as definitely relevant possibly relevant or irrelevant separate problem Assessment of reliability certainty of each finding It is normal for findings to be equivocal Inexperienced clinicians will have many more equivocal findings than will seasoned clinicians simply because of their lack of experience However not all equivocal findings pertain to experience of the clinician For example a heart murmur may be equivocal to the most talented cardiologist simply because that is the nature of the human body The important thing is to acknowledge equivocal findings when they occur Hypothesis generation This process begins during the patient encounter often within the first few minutes after the interaction has started While the clinician is still recording factual information either in written notes or in memory various pieces of information rise to the surface

P RO BL EM S OL VI NG S KI LL S 1 5 The skills used here are unique in that they are performed while the patient and clinician are speaking or while the clinician is examining the patient Such skills allow the clinician to process and refine the data as they are obtained Seasoned clinicians can perform most of thei r problem solving skills during this phase and the student will be increas ingly able to do so with experience and practice The goal of this phase is to develop a hypothesis or working diagnosis 3 4 diagnoses that might explain the patient s presentation This working diagnosis will generate a set of questions that the clinician needs to ask These questions will depend on the manifestations that the disease is expected to produce in a patient Note that hypothesis generation is not answer generation The process simply allows the clinician to prioritize possibilities Clinical decision making is derived from medical knowledge personal theories assumptions experi ence traditions and lore and this mental strategy is sometimes called medical heuristics such as gestalt and string along Skills used during hypothesis generation include consideration of demographics and chief complaint the limited survey and pattern recog nition We will explore the use of each of these tools briefly Demographics and the chief complaint Taking into account what is epidemiologically most likely in a given popu lation a small amount of information can yield surprisingly accurate hypotheses For example 32 year old woman with polyarthritis l rheumatoid arthritis 28 year old man with thrush l acquired immune deficiency syndrome A ID S Although gender ethnic and racial differences are generally de emphasized to prevent discrimination in some cases they are a valid or even necessary consideration 28 year old African American woman with hilar adenopathy l sarcoi dosis In the United States sarcoidosis affects blacks 10 20 times more commonly than it does whites In Europe the disease more commonly affects whites 22 year old woman of Mediterranean descent with hemolytic anemia l glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency It is important to consider however that the reason for the racial or gender differences may have been biased in the original observations as is the case for coronary artery disease in women

C HA PT ER 1 The diagnostic process 6 Survey of the possible causes This is based on only the initial presentation and accompanying symptoms It can be taken using one of the formats outlined below All formats should be used when doing a survey because a single format does not cover everything Organ system Though these are somewhat artificially divided they are easily recalled and understood allowing access to a comprehensive database Anatomy An anatomy survey is similar to one of an organ system but concerns the finer points of anatomy An anatomy survey lends itself well to the surgical specialties For example when considering the differential diag nosis of nausea and vomiting consider lesions in the external auditory canal as the general somatic afferent fibers from this area are carried by the vagus nerve which also carries parasympathetic fibers to the upper gastrointestinal G I tract Pathogenesis The pathological processes that cause disease can be classified and con sideration of this classification is helpful in generating hypotheses and differential diagnoses V IT AM IN C is one useful mnemonic for recalling these mechanisms of disease V vascular I infectious T toxic or traumatic A autoimmune M metabolic I idiopathic some call it inflammatory N neoplastic or nutritional C congenital or genetic Pattern recognition The expression when you hear hoof beats don t think zebras is a reminder that common diagnoses are common and should be considered f i r s t A s c l i n i c a l s k i l s i m p r o v e h o w e v e r s t u d e n t s b e c o m e a b l e t o c o n sider uncommon illnesses and atypical presentations It may help to think about each diagnosis you consider in the context of whether it is a common or uncommon illness and whether it is a typical or atypical pres entation An example of this process in relation to chest pain and shortness of breath is presented in Table 1 1

C HA PT ER 1 The diagnostic process 8 Syndrome recognition Syndromes are more specific than clusters i e they are more likely to have only one cause Often they are given names or eponyms For example Horner s syndrome ptosis miosis enophthalmos anhidrosis ipsilaterally Superior vena cava syndrome elevated jugular venous pressure visible anastamotic veins and reversal of flow of the supraumbilical veins Gestalt While this is a form of cluster the emphasis is on the relative ease of recognition of the whole picture rather than a more laborious construc tion of its parts The suffix oid allows the term to be used with suffi cient lack of precision The actual diagnosis of a syndrome or disease depends on the component parts and is associated with greater specificity For example Cushingoid habitus centripetal obesity Cushing s syndrome consists of truncal obesity hypertension fatigability amenorrhea hirsutism purple abdominal striae edema glucosuria and osteoporosis Cushing s disease as described by Cushing accompanying a basophilic pituitary tumor refers to this syndrome when the cause is specifically a pituitary tumor Note the increasing specificity from Cushingoid to Cushing s syndrome to Cushing s disease Finding a key clue This will be a maximally specific clue almost pathognomonic for a diagnosis in question for example the presence of splinter hemor rhages in the proximal nail beds in bacterial endocarditis If the other findings fit then you probably have the diagnosis If they don t then look further Such specific clues are not that common Template matching In this technique the clinician knows intimately all of the manifestations of a particular disease She or he will then try to fit the findings of the patient into the possible presentations of that disease Think of the disease in question as a blueprint and the findings are added into the blueprint in such a way that they ultimately fit the template This technique is the one most used by subspecialists who perform consults to determine whether a patient has a particular disease or not It is based on the fact that diseases present in multitudes of ways for reasons that are not always apparent Weight of evidence When all the findings do not neatly support a diagnosis one assesses where the weight of the evidence lies In other words if most of the findings support endocarditis but the blood cultures are negative the patient is still considered to have endocarditis However diagnostic errors can be made when using this technique See discussion in Dynamic Diagnoses and the Possibility of Cognitive Error p 12

P RO BL EM S OL VI NG S KI LL S 1 9 Timing of findings in relation to each other The closer in time two findings develop the more likely it is they are related Consider however that the two clues may be unrelated Use of algorithms Algorithms are specific for the symptom being addressed Experienced clinicians use these all the time but keep them recorded only in their minds Such algorithms that are in frequent use are generally too com plex to be printed easily because the branch points are highly detailed However simplified versions are very amenable to students use and can be sought on a case by case basis through each subspecialty String together technique This technique involves linkage of one finding to another e g dyspnea and chest pain in a blind 56 year old man who was completely healthy until he developed severe back pain from a ruptured disc Heavy ibupro fen use for the pain led to gastric ulceration with subsequent blood loss The blood loss manifested as melena black stools but was unapparent to the patient because of his sight impairment The anemia became so profound hemoglobin of 4 that he developed dyspnea and chest pain without having a significant degree of coronary atherosclerosis Generation of a differential diagnosis The top diagnoses are prioritized in two ways the most likely diagnoses and the most important ones i e urgent or life threatening The primary diagnosis the one suspected most is usually presented first with support ing evidence However occasionally there is a diagnosis that is urgent and this should be presented first even though it is less likely than the primary diagnosis For example consider a 40 year old female with abdominal cramping and uterine bleeding If the history and exam suggest the possi bility of an ectopic pregnancy this diagnosis should be listed first even though the more likely diagnosis is uterine fibroadenomas Frequently there are still some discrepant details in the primary diagnosis Early in the evaluation of a patient there may be missing data and the case cannot be made convincingly for the primary diagnosis Then other diagnoses should be discussed systematically as alternative diagnoses A seasoned clinician will be able to generate a primary diagnosis quickly but as discussed below cognitive bias may adversely impact the consid eration of other diagnoses It is usually best to consider at least three diagnoses A good habit is to consider diagnoses broadly enough to include at least three organs or categories of disease

C HA PT ER 1 The diagnostic process 12 Dynamic diagnoses the possibility of cognitive error Dynamic diagnoses and the possibility of cognitive error Clinical diagnosis is not a static classification system based on diagnostic criteria or their probable presence It is a dynamic process It is important to realize that the techniques described above including pattern recogni tion gestalt and template matching are critical to the efficient function of busy clinicians and are developed over time These methods can be regarded as a diagnostic snapshot of what is happening at a particular point in time However the patient s illness is a dynamic process that changes with time Changes in the patient s status and new laboratory and imaging data provide more information that needs to be accounted for in the evolving diagnosis and care process Diagnosis reflects the clinician s knowledge clinical acumen and problem solving skills In everyday practice clinicians use expert skills to arrive at a diagnosis often taking advantage of various mental shortcuts known as heuristics Although the final working diagnosis usually the primary diagnosis expedites the management plan it is a temporary diagnosis with much missing data The heuristics described above such as the string along method and gestalt also lend themselves to cognitive errors i e failures of percep tion and cognitive bias Interestingly cognitive errors are only rarely due to lack of medical knowledge Graber et al studied 100 cases of diagnostic error identified through autopsy discrepancies quality assurance activities and voluntary reports 1 They found that the underlying contributions to error fell into three natural categories no fault no identified process system related related to health system based processes and cognitive In their study the most common cognitive errors involved defective synthesis Prema ture closure i e the failure to continue considering reasonable alterna tives after a primary diagnosis is reached was the single most common cause This highlights the importance of recognizing that diagnosis is a dynamic process One example given in the study was a wrong diagnosis of musculoskeletal pain after a motor vehicle accident a ruptured spleen was eventually found Other common causes of cognitive error in Graber et al s study included faulty context generation misjudging the salience of findings faulty perception and errors arising from the use of heuristics Overall inadequate knowledge was least common Faulty context generation or failure to consider aspects of the pa tient s situation that are relevant to the diagnosis can be devastating 1 Graber M L Franklin N Gordon R 2005 Diagnostic error in internal medicine Arch Intern Med 165 1493 1499

C HA PT ER 1 The diagnostic process 14 Summary In summary the differential diagnosis is constructed only after all the data history physical laboratory findings and imaging are collected and organized Information processing is an important goal of the physician patient interaction It proceeds in three phases data processing hypothesis generation and finally generation of a differential diagnosis Data processing is a simple process of collecting all the findings and then trying to fit those findings together to make a more accurate hypothesis Data processing is not only critical to the development of a diagnosis but also helps the development of a problem list Hypothesis generation requires the use of multiple methods of aggre gating information These include pattern recognition techniques such as string along methods and gestalt Generation of a diagnosis is a dynamic process that depends on pattern recognition and experience The primary diagnosis the one most suspected or most life threatening is presented first with supporting evidence Other diagnoses should be routinely considered and discussed systematically as alternative diagnoses Clinicians use a complex method of clinical decision making that includes medical knowledge experience assumptions and traditions as hypothesis generating shortcuts These shortcuts allow for efficient information management in a time limited encounter however they may lend themselves to diagnostic error Diagnostic errors occur even with experienced clinicians Therefore broad differentials can mitigate some of these cognitive biases that may lead to medical errors

C HA PT ER 2 Transparent diagnosis 16 Transparent diagnosis The introductory chapter discussed the thought processes used when arriving at a diagnosis Many of these are subconscious and p oorly under stood for example pattern recognition There is also a tradition in medicine of discussing and justifying diagn o ses openly This happens during conferences on morbidity and mortality and on management for example the clinicopathological conferences C PCs at the Massachusetts General Hospital which have been pub lished for many years in the New England Journal of Medicine Eddy and Clanton studied the thought processes of doctors when they were analyzing symptoms signs and test results at these C PCs The authors concluded that they were searching for single items or aggre gates of information that were associated with as small a number of differential diagnoses as possible Any diagnosis chosen from this list became a hypothesis Eddy and Clanton referred to these hypothesis generating items as pivots 1 They were called diagnostic leads in articles describing the mathematical basis of this reasoning process 2 3 4 5 and this is what they are called in this book which is based on the detailed understanding described in these studies If such a lead was only associated with one diagnosis then it would be pathognomonic i e a necessary condition for that diagnosis and thus a part of the definition of the diagnosis In the absence of definitive diagnostic evidence the pivot or diagnostic lead is used to suggest a differential diagnosis and to generate hypotheses Eddy and Clanton described how experienced diagnosticians looked for further information to try to prune or rule out some of these hypo thetical possibilities until only one was confirmed If the remaining d iagnosis was confirmed by the combination of pivot and pruner then the items of information used to do this would be sufficient diagnostic criteria an d thus form a part of the diagnostic definition Such reasoning with definitive information can be represented easily with algorithms However in many cases the combination would not confirm the diagnosis but only point to it with a high probability thus suggesting it on the basis of weight of evidence 2 3 4 5 1 Eddy D M Clanton C H 1982 The art of diagnosis solving the clinicopathological conference N Engl J Med 306 1263 1268 2 Llewelyn D EH 1975 A concept of diagnosis A relationship between logic and limits of probability Clin Sci Mol Med 49 7 3 Llewelyn D EH 1979 Mathematical analysis of the diagnostic relevance of clinical findings Clin Sci 57 5 477 479 4 Llewelyn D EH 1981 Applying the principle of logical eliminatio n to probabilistic diagnosis Med Informatics 6 1 25 5 Llewelyn D EH 1988 Assessing the validity of diagnostic tests and clinical de cisions M D thesis University of London

T RA NS PA RE NT D IA GN OS IS 1 17 The problem is that students and inexperienced doctors may not have the knowledge to identify diagnostic leads and to chase up a diagnostic possibility by ruling out its rivals or showing that they are improbable These combinations are sometimes recognized without assembling them logically when they are referred to as key clues clusters or syn dromes that are pathognomonic or have short differential diagnoses This handbook provides its readers with this information to allow them to recognize the best diagnostic leads and to follow them by generating diagnostic hypotheses Each page heading represents a diagnostic lead and the page contains its differential diagnoses Alongside each of these diagnoses are the clinical findings that suggest that the diagnosis is prob able and the findings that confirm it by ruling out its rival diagnoses from the group of patients with that combination It is important to understand why the information needed to suggest or confirm diagnoses is usually small Many templates of disease have much in common e g many of the symptoms and physical signs of pneumonia pulmonary embolus and heart failure are the same It is the differences that allow the diagnostician to differentiate between them These differences are described in the pages of this book as findings that suggest or confirm diagnoses Negative findings are also important in this role of suggesting or confirming diagnoses but negative findings are not helpful as diagnostic leads because people with most other diseases and those who are healthy also have them The descriptions alongside each diagnosis on a page are often brief because the differences between diagnoses may be few This is why the diagnostic process may be difficult for the novice to master quickly but look simple in the hands of the expert who knows what to focus on Unlike textbooks that concentrate on describing diseases processes often in vivid and elegant detail this book focuses on findings that are useful during the diagnostic process to speed up the reader s acquisition of diagnostic skills The reader is encouraged to add to this information or modify it However little if any evidence has been collected yet to substantiate the performance of leads and differentiators How to use this book The book can be used in two ways 1 You may browse its pages and try to guess from your knowledge of anatomy or physiology the possible diagnoses linked to it You should keep covering the column of diagnoses and test to see whether you can guess each diagnosis by reading the findings that suggest or confirm it By doing this you will begin to acquire the type of knowledge used by experienced doctors at the C PCs 2 The book can also be used when solving diagnostic problems Write down your differential diagnoses and put in brackets after each diagnosis the positive and negative findings that you think support each diagnosis Look up the patient s positive findings in this book they will be repre sented by page headings If you see a diagnosis on the page that you have not considered consider it As you view the differential diagnoses you have considered look at the suggesting and confirming findings to see if you have already looked for them if not do so

C HA PT ER 2 Transparent diagnosis 18 The diagnostic lead Unless a finding happens to be a pathognomonic diagnostic criterion that already confirms a diagnosis it will be associated with more than one diagnosis It will therefore have to be interpreted in combination with other findings before a single diagnosis becomes more probable or can be confirmed These combinations may be recognized immediately as highly predictive clusters or syndromes If not the combination may have to be assembled logically by using one of the component findings as a lead and using the others to make up a combination that identifies a group of patients within which all but one diagnosis is improbable or eliminated Each page in Chapters 3 18 of this book is based on the conce pt of a lead that is predictive of a list of differential diagnoses The suggesting findings on each page can be used to make a diagnosis more probable the confirming findings will make that diagnosis certain The principle of using logic to assemble patterns or syndromes is as follows If a 24 year old man presents with acute abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant R LQ and is accompanied by guarding then this cluster of findings suggests appendicitis This working diagnosis might be confirmed during a laparotomy by seeing the definitive finding of a red swollen appendix and treated with appendectomy with resolution of the pain so that the diagnosis becomes final Logic based on proportions The same combination of findings can also be assembled logically because R LQ pain would be a good short lead due to appendicitis e g in 40 100 of hypothetical patients with the lead nonspecific abdominal pain N SA P e g in 60 100 Guarding occurs commonly in appendicitis but rarely in those with N SA P which means that the probable diagnosis is appendicitis Note that N SA P is an example of a group of very important diagnoses These are self limiting conditions that resolve spontaneously before any treatment other than relief of symptoms is required These nonspecific N S diagnoses e g N S headache N S chest pain are the most common diagnoses in medicine They are confirmed by careful follow up but typi cally present with a small number of symptoms and signs that are mild and of recent onset Learning to deal with these safely using appropriate follow up is one of the most important diagnostic skills to be acquired Diagnostic logic using proportions is helped by choosing a lead with a small number of diagnostic possibilities that account for a high propor tion of patients e g over 95 ideally 100 as in the above example Another important principle is that the low frequency of a single find ing gives an upper limit for the frequency of occurrence of a combination that includes that finding Thus if guarding occurs in 5 x 60 3 of those with N SA P then guarding with R LQ pain must occur in 3 patients or fewer as the presence or absence of R LQ pain will further subdivide the group of 3 who have guarding Care must be taken with the rest of the logic however If guarding occurs in 50 and R LQ pain also occurs in 50 of those with appendicitis it is possible that each finding occurs in different halves of the group w ith

T HE D IA GN OS TI C L EA D 1 19 appendicitis and that these findings never occur together in those with appendicitis Under these circumstances it would be wrong to assume that most patients with R LQ pain and guarding had appendicitis However if guarding occurred in 95 and R LQ pain occurred in 85 of those with appendicitis then even if they occur together as infrequently as possibl e i e there was maximum negative statistical dependency both have to occur in at least 80 i e 0 95 0 85 1 0 80 In terms of patient numbers this would be at least 80 x 40 32 of the original 100 patients Therefore appendicitis must occur in at least 32 32 3 91 of those with R LQ pain and guarding Assumptions and estimates It is commonly assumed that findings such as guarding and R LQ pain occur together by chance in conditions such as appendicitis This can be used to give an estimate of the likelihood of discovering a combination of findings in patients who have a diagnostic criterion Thus the likelihood of getting the combination of R LQ pain with guarding in those with appen dicitis would be assumed to be 95 x 85 80 75 This is called the statistical independence assumption However if R LQ pain and guarding were assumed to occur as often as possible in the same patients with appendicitis i e there was positive statistical dependency then the combination would occur in 85 of those with appendicitis Central evidence Once a diagnostic criterion is discovered e g a red swollen appendix as this does not occur in the other conditions by definition it rules them out completely The probability of the diagnosis e g of appendicitis then becomes 100 irrespective of the nature of the preceding findings Thus many findings discovered in the early part of the diagnostic proc ess are often not mentioned when better evidence becomes available later even if the better evidence does not give 100 certainty Better evidence is often assumed to give a good estimate of the probability for the total evidence This small combination of powerful evidence is often called the relevant or central evidence However the patient s original presenting complaint is always relevant because unless it resolves th e diagnosis does not become final An alternative or additional diagnosis may have to be considered to explain the patient s findings Evidence based differential diagnosis In practice this reasoning process is done informally and little thought is given to the underlying rigorous logical principles frequencies or simplify ing assumptions However if we wish to practice evidence based medicine and evidence based diagnosis it is important that careful thought be given to the underlying logical principles of diagnosis It will be necessary to collect data on the frequency in diagnostic leads or pivots of various diagnoses This will include clinical findings and te st results including numerical test results in different clinical settings It will also be important to determine the frequencies of symptoms signs and distributions of numerical test results in patients with various differential diagnoses and in patients with diagnoses of different degrees of severity

C HA PT ER 2 Transparent diagnosis 20 Differential diagnosis and diagnostic screening The arithmetic used to represent the screening of populations for diagnoses is different from the arithmetic of differential diagnosis It might be helpful to an epidemiologist to know the proportion of times a particular diagnosis will be confirmed in due course after the positive screening test has been investigated to determine its cause One can measure this proportion directly in a study e g of 12 patients who are dipstick positive for micro albumin 8 turn out eventually to have incipient nephropathy However instead of measuring the proportion of 8 12 directly this frequency of 8 12 0 75 is usually calculated by epidemiologists and statisticians indirectly by applying Bayes theorem to 1 an estimate of the prevalence or incidence of the diagnosis 2 the prevalence or incidence of the screening test result in the population to be studied and 3 an estimate of the frequency of the test result in those confirmed to have the diagnosis Screening in the diagnostic setting It is not only epidemiologists who perform screening tests These tests are also performed by primary care physicians and specialists who look after populations of patients who are asympt omatic but who have a high risk of developing some condition e g diabetic nephropathy If such a patient is asked open questions e g Do you have any symptoms that you wish to tell me about severe symptoms may be remembered but minor ones may be forgotten If the patient is asked closed questions e g Does your urine froth sometimes then fewer symptoms may be missed but spurious posi tive responses may be given perhaps to agree with the doctor Similarly if a detection process is made more biochemically sensitive e g by calling a smaller color change on the urine dipstick paper positive then it may result in more spurious false positive results However if the process is modified by calling only a larger color test change on the urine dipstick positive it may be less biochemically and statistically sensitive If a sensitive screening test is negative the patient is usually reassured that no further tests are necessary However if for example a preliminary urine test for microalbuminuria is positive then the confirmatory tests of three 24 hour urine collections together with urine microscopy and culture may have to be done to see if early diabetic nephropathy is present Waiting rooms and Venn diagrams The accompanying Venn diagram Fig 2 1 represents 20 diabetic patients in a waiting room of whom 9 are known to have incipient nephropathy Twelve patients have a positive dipstick test There are 8 patients with incipient nephropathy who are dipstick positive these are enclosed in the overlapping circles There are 7 patients who have no incipient neph ropathy and are dipstick negative and they fall outside both circles There are 4 patients who are dipstick positive with no incipient neph ropathy and a single patient who is dipstick negative with nephropathy These numbers are also represented in the usual 2 x 2 table see Table 2 1 which also show the totals with and without incipient nephropathy and those who are dipstick positive and dipstick negative

C HA PT ER 2 Transparent diagnosis 22 Effect of clinical setting on diagnostic probabilities The nature of the clinical setting can affect the predictive probabilities of the differential diagnoses of diagnostic leads The group discussed previ ously was patients in a diabetic follow up clinic waiting room The data might be different in another setting such as a primary care waiting room for asymptomatic patients having annual checkups or an antenatal clinic For example if another waiting room contained many new diabetic patients the prevalence of incipient nephropathy might be lower e g 4 20 because the nephropathy in newly diagnosed diabetics was at an earlier stage so that fewer would test positive with a dipstick e g the sensitivity might be 2 4 If the incidence of a newly dipstick positive result was 8 20 the positive predictive value in this new setting would be less at 2 8 4 20 x 2 4 8 20 2 8 Probability map Dipstick positive Dipstick negative Incipient nephropathy No incipient nephropathy 8 98 12 9 20 12 20 11 208 20 4 121 91 84 11 7 11 7 8 Sensitivity Positive Predictive value Specificity Negative predictive value Study population False negative rate False positive rate Figure 2 2 Probability map Diagnostic leads again If the predictive value of a positive dipstick was 2 8 this begs the ques tion what was producing the positive result in the other 6 8 or 75 of patients In this new clinic we might find that 2 8 had a urinary tract infection and 4 8 had nonspecific microalbuminuria which means that when another urine specimen was taken the test was negative This might mean that new patients were less expert at producing an uncon taminated specimen In the diabetic follow up clinic the positive predictive value was 8 12 so that only 4 12 33 3 had some other diagnosis e g 3 12 had a urinary tract infection U TI and only 1 12 of these patients had nonspe cific microalbuminuria

C HA PT ER 2 Transparent diagnosis 24 Gold standard diagnostic criteria are they valid Pay careful attention to the patient s diagnosis when considering if a treatment is expected to be of benefit It does not matter how powerful a treatment might be it will not work if it is given to the wrong patients and may indeed do more harm than good by causing adverse effe cts with no prospect of benefit The role of a physician is to decide which patients will benefit from a specific treatment or advice and this is done by arriving at a diagnosis For this reason the explanation given for a treatment is bound up with the diagnosis This applies to the explanation for how the treatment changes the imagined underlying process and to the pragmatic result of a clinical trial comparing the response to treatment with that of something else So a perfectly valid diagnostic criterion will help to identify all those and only those patients who will respond to a treatment If only a proportion of patients respond to a treatment then it is better to subdivide the diagnosis to identify those who do and those who do not respond For example only a proportion of patients suffering from a myocardial infarction M I benefit from thrombolysis or angioplasty However more patients with S T elevation do so The diagnosis of M I has thus been subdivided into S T elevation M I with a high response rate to thrombolysis or angioplasty and non S T elevation M I which identifies those who are not very responsive and thus not offered these treatments The ability of a diagnostic criterion to predict treatment response is known as its validity The most valid test result for an evolving M I would be the one that identified all those and only those who responded to thrombolysis or angioplasty Note that M I now envelops other diag nos tic groups or sets This is the case for many diagnoses diabe tes mellitus being an important example One of the diagnoses it envelops is incipient diabetic nephropathy If a gold standard test i e diagnostic criterion is based on a meas urement another factor that needs determining is the best cutoff point For example the upper limit of the normal range for the albumin excretion rate A ER is 20 g min based on samples taken from healthy laboratory volunteers This cutoff point is also used to decide if a diabetic patient has incipient diabetic nephropathy by assuming that all those above this level are at significantly increased risk of nephropathy e g within 2 years However if only a small proportion of patients with an initial rate between 20 and 40 g min develop nephropathy as shown in Fig 2 3 then nephropathy will be incipient for a very few only If the risk of nephropathy rises rap idly above 40 g min this might be a more suitable cutoff point for incipient diabetic nephropathy 1 1 Llewelyn D EH Garcia Puig J 2004 How different urinary albumin excretion rates can predict progression to nephropathy and the effect of treatment in hypertensive dia betics J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst 5 141 145

C HA PT ER 2 Transparent diagnosis 26 Working diagnoses and final diagnoses Many patients have symptoms physical signs and tests results that do not satisfy diagnostic criteria Some diagnostic criteria are not easily ac cessible for example they depend on histology or an appearance at major surgery We may thus have to begin treatment when there are no recognized criteria For example most antibiotics are prescribed for a chest infection be fore it is confirmed by culturing bacteria However when we decide to treat we always assume that if a randomized controlled trial were to be done on such a group of patients more would benefit from treatment than from placebo but we would think so with more confidence when there is a diagnostic criterion If we are asked to explain why we chose that particular treatment we could say that we imagine the presence of the disease process for the time being This is called a working diagnosis It is equivalent to a scientific hypothesis during an experiment If the patient gets better in the ex pected way and if there was no practical purpose for doing further tests then we would then assume that we were correct This would be called a final diagnosis It would be the same as a hypothesis becoming a scientific theory because there is no immediate intention to do another experiment to test it In both cases we would be citing an imagined process knowing that it was theoretical and not proven i e by direct observation of everything being imagined In the case of a treatment we would not have been able to prove that the patient would not have gotten better anyway without the treatment In order to prove this we would have to do the impossi ble by turning the clock back and not giving the treatment to see what happens It should also be remembered that even if diagnostic criteria are pre sent this does not guarantee a response to treatment Diagnostic criteria are there for consistency between different doctors diagnoses and they also allow randomized trials to be done and the knowledge to be shared Thus if the diagnostic criteria were chosen carefully to be valid in terms of predicting outcome then more patients would respond to treatment and fewer to placebo in a clinical trial when using the criterion than when not using it If we stray away from such published clinical trial criteria when giving treatments then we have to accept that we are guessing treatment response by extrapolation and not basing it on for mal documented experience in that clinical trial If the patient failed to respond to the treatment that might lead to a final diagnosis then we would carry out further tests to discover if there is evidence for some other diagnosis or to look for further evidence for the original diagnosis that simply did not respond to the treatment This further evidence might be a successful response to some other treatment that could work for the original working diagnosis

W OR KI NG D IA GN OS ES A ND F IN AL D IA GN OS ES 1 27 The practical purpose of a diagnosis from the patient s point of view is to predict the outcomes of a distressing complaint with or without treatment Sophisticated technology is there to improve the validity of diagnostic criteria in terms of their ability to predict what will happen to the patient s symptoms A diagnosis represents imagination that includes clinical findings and test results so it can never be proven to be true in its entirety by a single test The number of detailed imaginary models e g at the molecular level under the umbrella term of diagnosis is limited only by the human imagination Science is concerned with imaginative theories or models that can be tested against observed facts documented and then shared with others I f n o a s p e c t o f a t h e o r y c a n b e t e s t e d b y a n y f o r m o f o b s e r v a t i o n i t cannot be the subject of scientific study The process of imagining more models of disease and discarding some of them because they do not fit the facts results in scientific models becoming more detailed One effect of this is that diagnoses may become subdivided e g M I has become subdivided into S T elevation M I respon sive to thrombolysis or angioplasty and non S T elevation M I which is not So a working or final diagnosis is simply the title to a model hypothe sis or theory that explains and connects the combination of pre treatment facts e g chest pain with S T elevation to an outcome of treatment with or without a treatment e g lowering of raised S T segments after thrombolysis In addition to this imaginative view of diagnosis there is also the public logical approach which is the main subject of this book

C HA PT ER 2 Transparent diagnosis 28 Dynamic diagnoses It is important to understand that clinical diagnosis is not a static classifi cation system based on diagnostic criteria or their probable presence It is a dynamic process Diagnostic algorithms classify patients by following a logical pathway This works bests when interpreting components of diagnostic criteria Other systems use findings such as symptoms and physical signs to predict the probable presence of diagnostic criteria All of these methods can be regarded as diagnosing a snapshot of wh at is happening at a particular time However the diagnostician will be tryi ng to imagine the presence of a dynamic process that changes with time Thi s could be over seconds minutes hours days weeks months or years and the response in terms of investigation and treatment has to be timed appropriately There may be several processes taking place at the same time some progressing over years e g atheromatous changes some over minutes to hours e g a thrombosis in a coronary artery some over minutes or seconds e g ventricular tachycardia and others instantaneously e g a cardiac arrest This means that a diagnostic process leading to treatment may have to happen repeatedly and for a number of diagnoses at the same time It might be more appropriate to think of the process as one of feed b a c k c o n t r o l I n t h i s w a y t h e d o c t o r w o u l d b e a c t i n g a s a n e x t e r n a l control mechanism to assist those of the patient that are failing After the initial history and examination the feedback information may come from electronic monitoring nursing observations ward rounds or hospital clinic or primary care follow up The mechanisms of interest to the diagnostician are of three types The first type is mechanisms that control the internal milieu by keeping tem perature tissue perfusion blood gases and biochemistry constant The second type is those mechanisms that control the body s structure by effecting repair in response to any damage The third type consists of those that control the external milieu of day to day living These three types are all interdependent If one mechanism fails it may unmask other weaknesses by causing other failures It may not be enough to treat the main failure It is often necessary also to treat the causes a nd consequences as they may be unable to recover on their own For exam ple a coronary thrombosis may be treated with thrombolysis but an y resulting rhythm abnormalities may need to be treated as well as the causative risk factors e g smoking that could result in recurrence So when we explain our diagnostic thought processes it helps to think of each diagnosis as a subheading with its own evidence and decision The process of taking a history and examining a new patient may take about an hour If the patient is acutely ill there may have to be an urgent life saving diagnosis and treatment with a reassessment every few min utes until the patient is stable The presenting complaint and a quick examination may also suggest a minor complaint such as a viral sore throat that is best managed by simple measures and by having the patient return in a few days

D YN AM IC D IA GN OS ES 1 29 What all these diagnostic approaches have in common is a cycle of evidence gathering working diagnosis with or without a diagnostic crite rion and management The management may involve tests treatments and their results which produce further evidence a revised diagnosis and further management The probability of any diagnosis being confirmed with diagnostic criteria or becoming the final diagnosis by responding to treatment may not be very high initially However you can reassure the patient that the follow up process will allow further attempts to take place until you get it right In many cases the problem will resolve spontaneously before you can arrive at any diagnosis that suggests a treatment In other cases you may have to observe the patient closely as the mystery disease progresses so that new evidence becomes available In this way uncertainty may be overcome by cycles of follow up and review

C HA PT ER 2 Transparent diagnosis 30 Transparency and replication Physicians work closely with patients relatives other physicians and members of other disciplines They frequently hand over care to others who have to understand what is happening and if they agree to continue with the plan There is little place in all of this for mystery and obscurity which may arouse suspicion about the doctor s motives or competence An experienced doctor would know quickly if the evidence did not add up He or she would check with the patient to see if the presenting complaint is accurate and to check if the evidence given justifies accepting the main diagnosis It is also easy to see if all the necessary treatments have been given The same can be done for all the other diagnoses If there is doubt about the diagnoses because there is insufficient evi dence then other diagnoses may also have to be considered and added to the list One reason for such doubt would be if the patient still has symptoms that are slow to resolve If there is doubt as to whether the answers are sensible then the history and examination has to be repeated If th e sam e find ings are d iscove red ag ain th en the y can be s aid to have been corroborated or replicated Evidence is of two types The first type is the particular evidence displayed in that particular situation for a particular patient It has to be given with a time and place and in enough detail to allow a listener to question the witness or to repeat the observations so that they can be replicated along with the reasoning process and decision The same principles are used in the legal profession The second part of the evidence is experience from many similar past situations and their outcomes which demonstrated that a high propor tion were successful This is general evidence in contrast to the particular evidence For a treatment it would consist of what happened in a cli nical trial to some patients on the treatment and to others on a placebo or something else The problem is that such general or scientific ev idence is not available for much of what we do in medicine especially when using different diagnostic criteria or gold standard tests General scientific evidence is based on observations made on grou ps of individuals who each have their own particular observations If a listener is going to accept such observations as general scientific evi dence the results and methods have to be described in sufficient detail to be repeated by someone else and thus for the study result to be replicated if necessary If the study and its description is of high quality and published in a reputable journal which reflects the quality then the reader may not feel obliged to repeat it One criterion is that there was a sensible hypothesis and thus a good reason for doing the study i e that it was not just a chance observation Another important criterion would be that the numbers of observations made were high so that the statistical probability of replicating the study result was high e g there was a 95 chance of getting a repeat result between two clinically acceptable confidence limits

T RA NS PA RE NC Y A ND R EP LI CA TI ON 1 31 Modern medicine involves careful evidence gathering and the use of imagination to decide on the best action These actions are then explaine d to others with diagnoses and evidence for those diagnoses There is thus a private imaginative stage and then a public transparent stage to allow others to decide if they can agree If it is not possible to provide a clear rationale in a way that can be understood by others who will be affected by an action then the wisdom of the action should be reconsidered One way of providing such a transparent rationale is to set out a diag nostic opinion in writing with clear particular evidence in support o f each diagnosis for others to discuss see Box 2 1 This format for supporting a diagnosis with evidence that suggests or confirms the diagnosis is used throughout this book Box 2 1 Diagnoses with particular evidence and management Acute follicular tonsillitis Evidence severe sore throat sweats and severe malaise for 2 days Bilaterally swollen tonsils large and red with small white patches W BC 18 33 x 109 L neutrophils 90 Management throat swab sent Start penicillin V 500 mg po qd acetaminophen 1 g po qd and review with bacteriology Probable type I I diabetes mellitus Evidence glycosuria random blood sugar 150 mg d L Management for fasting blood sugar when current acute illness resolved Healthy diet meanwhile Controlled thyrotoxicosis Evidence presented 2 months ago with anxiety weight loss abnormal thyroid function tests in Osler Hospital Management continue taking carbimazole 5 mg po qd Anxiety about meningitis Evidence voiced concerns during history Management details of this summary explained to patient Inadequate home care Evidence lives alone with no friends nearby Management assist patient to contact family

C HA PT ER 2 Transparent diagnosis 32 Differences of opinion about a diagnosis Differences of opinion can sometimes cause consternation a common reaction is that someone has to be wrong Different opinions can all be valid if they are based on documented experience and framed as prob ability statements with a sensible element of doubt For example if a physician makes a number of different predictions with 50 certainty and 50 turn out to be correct overall this shows good overall judgment Different members of the team can thus hold different valid opinions about a diagnosis for a particular patient on the basis of their different personal experiences A doctor may be wrong about a prediction for a particular patient and yet be correct 75 of the time for such predic tions with a 75 probability when they are all taken together in the long run However if a single opinion has to be adopted by a team to decide what should be done for a particular patient then traditionally the opin ion of the most senior member present is adopted usually after this person has listened carefully to others If an opinion is totally certain then it implies that all other opinions must be wrong An opinion held with certainty also raises questions about the holder s judgment because in the long run it is unlikely that 100 of predictions will be correct An opinion may become distorted consciously or subconsciously because the holder stands to gain person ally from its implementation It is therefore important to be able to reas sure patients and team members if there are differences of opinion It is also important not to confuse opinions about outcomes with rules that a team has agreed to abide by A team member may point out that a rule should be followed this is not an overconfident opinion but a fact if it was agreed at a particular time and place Overconfidence is also dif ferent from decisiveness One can be decisive by choosing an option with a low probability of success because it represents the best of a number of poor options Differences of opinion may occur because the particular facts on which they are based are different The first thing to do when there is a differ ence of opinion therefore is to check the particular facts for the patient and if necessary review the methods and conventions used by the team to get agreement This process may allow facts to be replicated see Transparency and Replication p 30 The second thing to do is to clarify the personal and published experi ence on which the opinion and probability are based This would include the facts that identified the group of patients who were followed and the details of outcomes such as the diagnostic criteria used or the treatment results Clarification of the facts often leads to agreement by revealing over sights and misunderstandings or pooling of experience Meta analysis is a technique for combining data from different publications Bayesian statis ticians also combine documented data with personal undocumented subjective experience Decision analysis can be used to ask patients opinions of how they would feel about different outcomes so that this can be taken into account when interpreting the meta analyses and the personal experiences of doctors

C HA PT ER 3 History taking skills and imagination 36 History taking with imagination The aim of the diagnostic process is to build an imaginative picture of what is happening to the patient Diagnosis is derived from the Greek to see through i e the history physical examination special investiga tions and response to treatment The diagnosis must not imply that there is only some single hidden process that needs to be discovered The diagnosis or diagnostic formula tion may have to include various causes consequences interactions and other independent processes As well as internal medical processes it has to include external factors such as circumstances at home and the effects on self care employment and leisure Clearly the most informative part of this broad diagnostic process will be the history The history also enables patients and supporters to iden tify the issues that they want addressed in terms of discomfort loss of function and difficulties with day to day existence Gold standards for final diagnoses are best based on the outcome of patients symptoms combined with the result of histology biochemistry or some other measurements So final diagnoses are often based on initial history taking skills from which outcomes can be assessed Observe normal social conventions Introduce yourself politely and invite the patient and any accompanying persons to do the same Check details such as the patient s date of birth address etc It is then important to establish very clearly why the patient has sought help This is known as the chief or presenting complaint Ask the patient about its severity and duration and always record this Be prepared to act immediately to give symptomatic relief e g for pain if the patient is distressed In some cases the chief complaint may not explain the decision to seek help The patient may be too ill shy guilty or embarrassed to describe what is happening accurately In other cases it may be someone else who is unduly worried e g the wife of a lethargic husband parents of a child or caregivers of an elderly person who can no longer cope Be alert and explore the real reason if there is doubt Having established the chief complaint s establish the factual details of place and time It is the ability to give a place and time that establishes the complaints as facts Medicine shares this convention with pure sci ence and law Listen to what the patient says without prompting first but if neces sary ask where they were and what they were doing when the problem was first noticed This will help the patient to recall what happened and also stimulate your own diagnostic imagination Establish the speed of initial onset and subsequent change in severity with time This helps you to imagine the kind of pathological process that is taking place An onset within seconds suggests a fit or heart rhythm abnormality over minutes a bleed or clotting process hours to days an acute infection days to weeks a chronic infection weeks to months a tumor and months to years a degenerative process

T HE P RE LI MI NA RY D IA GN OS IS 1 47 The preliminary diagnosis Most of the diagnostic information is contained in the history Much of the physical examination is directed at looking for information to help to confirm or exclude the diagnostic possibilities raised by the history It is therefore worth pausing at the end of the history to think about the diagnostic possibilities so far In some professional examinations the candidate is asked only to take a history and to give diagnostic conclusions and a management plan of investigations and treatment options Following is a reasonable differential for the main diagnosis Viral pharyngitis means a reasonable probability e g 20 80 Glandular fever Acute follicular tonsillitis Agranulocytosis due to carbimazole Meningococcal meningitis means a low probability e g 20 Other diagnoses might be Inadequate domestic support currently for acute illness Undiscovered type 2 diabetes mellitus The part of the physical examination to concentrate on would be the appearance of the pharynx and tonsils to see if the latter resembled strawberries and cream suggestive of acute follicular tonsillitis or simple redness with no pus suggestive of a pharyngitis possibly of viral origin Look for enlarged lymph nodes in the neck to support a brisk response to infection and neck stiffness that would support meningitis The special investigations would include an urgent white cell count W BC to see if there were absent or low white cells confirming agranu locytosis raised neutrophil white cells suggesting bacterial infection or raised lymphocytes suggesting viral infection Urine should be tested for sugar and a fasting blood sugar test done The immediate treatment options would be to continue the acetamino phen for pain relief and offer additional analgesia such as codeine phosp hate You will hear of many different approaches to history taking Make up your own mind and write out your approach on the blank pages pro vided near here or inside the front cover of the book Write out your own plan like the one in the following section Although there are benefits to taking a systematic approach especially if you are a student or doctor faced with an unfamiliar problem consulta tions may have to be very rapid with shortcuts The circumstances may disrupt any attempt to be systematic for example when examining a fractious child or when faced with several injured or very sick patients To be effective you should think in an orderly way by identifying the most urgent issue first then running through in your mind the other issues to be considered For each issue keep thinking What are the facts symptoms signs and test results What do I imagine is going on the diagnoses What should I do tests treatments and advice When you write down an account later do so in response to the same questions Within each of these questions consider what is happening in each system You can do this using sieves

C HA PT ER 19 Chest X ray appearances 438 The general approach 1 Use optimal viewing conditions preferably recessed lighting to avoid monitor glare 2 Check the patient s name gender age and medical record number to ensure correct identity 3 Check if the film is labeled P A X rays passing from posterior to anterior in a standard way or A P X rays passing from anterior to posterior A P views are commonly performed when the patient is ill using a portable X ray tube These views will often be semi erect films with suboptimal exposure factors X rays passing through the body from anterior to posterior magnify the mediastinum therefore A P films should not be used to assess cardiac size or hilar configuration 4 Check which sides are labeled left and right and whether the cardiac apex is on the left if not the patient may have dextrocardia 5 Check the patient s positioning Are the sternoclavicular joints equi distant from the spinous processes of the vertebral column If not then the patient was rotated Rotation causes asymmetry of shoulder girdle muscles projected over the lung fields Consequently the side that has the less space between the end of the clavicle and spinous process has more muscle projected over the lung fields and is whiter than the other side Be cautious in the interpretation of a rotated chest radiograph 6 Check to see if the vertebral column is visible through the heart shadow If not then it is under penetrated the X ray beam was too weak normal lung tissue will look abnormally opaque white 7 Check to see if the lung fields appear dark If they are and the verte bral column can be seen very clearly and the heart shadow is vague the film is over penetrated and abnormalities may be missed 8 Check to ensure the diaphragm is between the fifth and sixth anterior rib ends If it is higher then the patient did not take a deep breath and interpretation of the appearance of the lungs and mediastinum will be suboptimal If the diaphragmatic domes are flattened then emphysematous changes are likely 9 After addressing the basic technical issues are there objects in the X ray that strike you immediately Check for foreign bodies e g endotracheal tubes catheters chest drains etc A striking radio opaque white or lucent dark area is likely to be a good lead 10 Assess the X ray systematically for subtle abnormalities by a initially looking at the film without considering the clinical scenario There is often a tendency to miss obvious things that do not fit with the differential diagnosis Afterwards review the X ray again with the clinical information in mind b looking at each lung separately starting at the base and progressing to the apex carefully looking for abnormalities Compare the left to the right lung by starting at the lung bases and progressing to the apices scanning from the lateral border or the right lung to the lateral border of the left lung and back to the opposite side and repeating until the apices are reached Look behind the heart and below the diaphragm

1 1 Introduction 1 1 What are Respiratory Diseases Respiratory diseases are illnesses that affect the organs and tissues in the lungs and airway systems making gas exchange and breathing difficult The airway systems start from the nose lead to the large and small wind pipes and reach the lungs These s ystems are divided into upper and lower respiratory systems Respiratory conditions include acute respiratory infections as well as chronic respiratory diseases Most common respiratory diseases include influenza pneumonia asthma bronchitis chronic obs tructive airways disease C OA D and lung cancer 1 2 How common are Respiratory Diseases Lower respiratory infection was the 3 rd and chronic obstructive airways disease C OA D was the 6 th leading cause of death in the country in 2019 Global Health Metrics 2019 In the Solomon Islands 59 of children under 5 years of age experienced moderat e or severe acute respiratory infection A RI and were taken to a health facility in 2019 M HM S Statistical Health Core Indicator Report 2019 Influenza and pneumonia deaths alone reached 171 or 7 of total deaths making it the 5 th leading cause of de ath in the country W HO 2018 This guide will provide information on the most important respiratory diseases in the Solomon Islands influenza and pneumonia

2 2 Influenza 2 1 What is influenza flu Influenza flu is a sickness of the respiratory or breathing airway tubes which can infect the nose throat and tubes in the lungs It can cause mild to severe illness and at times can lead to death 2 2 What causes Influenza The influenza is caused by germ s or viruses that infects the nose throat and lungs 2 3 Which part of the body does it affect The germ or virus starts attacking the respiratory or breathing airway tubes which start from the nose to the throat and lead to the lungs 2 4 How does influenza spread These germs or viruses spread when people with flu cough sneeze or talk sending tiny droplets small water balls with the virus into the air People nearby may be infected if they inhale them or breath them in through the mou th or nose People might get flu by touching a surface of a table a chair or an object that has the flu germ or virus on it and then touching their own mouth nose or eyes

3 2 5 Who are the people at risk Anyone can be affected but the 5 groups below are at high risk of developing influenza related sicknesses 1 Children younger than 5 year s old especially those younger than 2 years old 2 Adults older than 65 years of age 3 People with c hronic illnesses C hronic Obstructive Airways Diseases C OA D heart disease s diabetes liver and kidney disorders 4 People with a w eakened immunity system body soldier 5 Pregnant women and women up to 2 weeks postpartum after giving birth amputated leg due to diabetes

4 2 6 What are the signs and symptoms Flu usually comes on quite quickly People who have flu often feel some or all of these symptoms 2 7 How can you treat influenza There is no cure for influenza The body takes care of the virus Recovery can be improve d with supportive care such as bed rest and take plenty of fluids to treat the flu If you are sick with flu like illness stay home for at least 24 hours one day after your fever is gone Your fever should be gone without taking any medicine for fever You could take herbal tea lemon tea guava tea ginger tea and green tea to relax breathing muscles to breath freely fever or feeling feverish chills cough runny or stuffy nose sore throat muscle or body aches fatigue tiredness headaches home remedies

5 2 8 What is the complication of influenza Flu can develop into the complicatio n such as pneumonia dehydration ear infections and sinus infections especially in children The flu can worsen long term medical conditions like congestive heart failure asthma or diabetes 2 9 How can you prevent influenza 1 Practice good health habits asthma wash hands with soap be physically active eat healthy food drink plenty of fluids manage your stress or worries get plenty of sleep avoid wet diapers avoid cold It is important to practice the following healthy habits to prevent flu

6 2 Avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth 3 Avoid close contact with people who are sick 4 When you are sick stay home and away from work school and tasks to avoid infect ing others 5 Cough and sneeze into your shirt or inside your elbow You could also cover your nose and mouth with a tissue Throw the tissue in the rubbish bin after you use it 6 Clean surfaces and objects with detergent or soap to kill germs like flu virus 7 If soap and water are not available for handwashing use an alcohol based hand rub 8 Get vaccination or nila against flu if available hand sanitizer

7 3 Pneumonia Pneumonia kills millions of people annually and is a leading cause of death among infants Globally m ore than 808 000 children under the age of 5 died of pneumonia in 2017 accounting for 15 of all deaths in this age group People at risk for pneumonia al so include adults over the age of 65 and people with underlying health problems W HO 3 1 What is Pneumonia Pneumonia is an infection sickness in one or both lungs The infection causes inflammation swelling in the air bags in the lungs which are called alveoli When t he alveoli are filled with fluid or pus they caus e cough with pus and difficult y to breathe It mainly affects small children adults aged 65 or older and people with weak immunity body soldier 3 2 What causes Pneumonia The main germ which causes sickness pneumonia are bacteria called streptococcus pneumoniae It occurs when there is a breakdown in your body s immunity or body soldier is weak and allows germs to come in and multiply within the lungs 3 3 How does Pneumonia spread The germs that cause pneumonia are very infectious which means that it can easily pass from one person to another Pneumonia germ or b acteria can spread to others through inhalation or breathing in of airborne droplets water float in air from a sneeze or cough You can also get pneumonia by coming into contact with surfaces of tables chairs or objects that are contaminated with pneumonia causing bacteria on them

8 3 4 What are the signs and symptoms Signs and s ymptoms of pneumonia can be mild moderate or severe which include Other symptoms can vary according to your age and general health Fast breathing or wheezing whistling sound in children under 5 years old Vomiting feeling weak or hav ing trouble drinking or eating in infants Confusion not sure and with unusually low body temperature in older people fatigue or feelings of tiredness sweating or chills body shaking fever chest pain that s worse when you breathe or cough shortness of breath short wind that occurs while doing normal activities or even while resting cough that may produce mucus nguru headaches nausea or vomiting loss of appetite don t feel like eating

9 3 5 How can you treat Pneumonia It is important that you go to a clinic hospital to see a nurse or doctor to get treatment medicine for the sickness pneumonia Treatment medicine will depend on the type of pneumonia you have and how severe or dangerous it is The nurse or doctor will give you the right medicine for your pneumonia Pneumonia that is caused by bacteria is treated with antibiotics These medicines kill the se bacteria germs Most people can take antibiotic tablets at home but some people need to be treated in the hospital It is very important to take your full course of antibiotics medicine as advised by nurse or doctor even if you begin to feel better Clinic Hospital Care At the clinic hospital a nurse or doctor keep s track of your heart rate temperature and breathing and give the treatment Antibiotics medicine is commonly injecte d straight into a vein in the body Respiratory treatment involves giving special medicine directly into the lungs or teaching patient s to breath e deeply to increase oxygen intake Oxygen treatment may be given to keep oxygen levels in your blo odstream received through a nasal tube face mask or ventilator depending on how severe or dangerous the pneumonia

10 Home Care Home remedies Some p lants help alleviate symptoms For example peppermint tea for cough ginger or turmeric tea is for chest pain warm liquid for chill s You can help your body recover by getting a lot of rest and drinking plenty of fluids Aspirin or paracetamol may be taken to reduce fever and pain at home if given or recommended by the nurse or doctor Cough medicine may be taken to calm your cough so you can rest Remember that coughing helps remove fluid from your lungs so you don t want to stop coughing entirely Special Reminder Seek help from nurses It is v ery important to recogni se severe symptoms and quickly go to see a nurse or doctor in the nearest clinic or hospital In some village s there is a local myth or belief which recogni ses any pain in the knee and body muscles as pneumonia If you have such pain seek help from a nurse or doc tor from the nearest clinic or hospital

11 3 6 What are complications of Pneumonia If you have other existing health conditions pneumonia could make them worse These conditions include Heart failure fluid builds up within the heart and causes heart muscles to be weak to pump efficiently Chronic lung sickness air bags in the lungs alveoli are damaged caus ing shortness of breath Blood poisoning bacteria germ s from the pneumonia infection may spread to your bloodstream and damage body organs This can lead to very low blood pressure septic shock and in some cases organ failure Lung abscesses these are cavities holes in the lungs that contain pus Antibiotic medicine can treat them Sometimes they may require drainage or operate on the lungs to remove the pus Breathing problem you may have trouble getting enough oxygen when you breathe You may need to use a ventilator or machine that helps breathing Water on the lungs If your pneumonia isn t treated you may develop fluid around your lungs in your pleura membrane or skin covering of the lungs called pleural effusion The fluid may become infected and need to be drained In some cases pneumonia can be deadly if not treated early

12 3 7 How do you prevent Pneumonia Pneumonia sickness can be prevented through the following Everyday practice Get enough rest eat a healthy diet and do regular exercise Maintain a healthy lifestyle to strengthen your immune system body soldier to fight sickness Stop s moking because it damages the lungs of you and of people around you Those exposed to tobacco smoke are more likely to get respiratory infections especially pneumonia Have your kitchen well ventilated with windows to avoid breathing fire smoke Regularly wash your hands with soap and water Cough and sneeze into your shirt inside your elbow or use a tissue paper Promptly dispose used tissues into a rubbish bin Try to stay away from crowded places Overcrowding is a main cause of spread of respiratory diseases regular exercise healthy diet enough sleep hours walking outdoors drink plenty water plenty of rest

13 Clinical intervention Vaccination or nila can be given by a nurse or doctor if it is available in the clinic or hospital

14 Glossary of Terminology Antibiotic s They are medicines that fight infections caused by bacteria in humans Bacteraemia It is blood poisoning in which a bacterial infection has spread to the bloodstream This is serious because it can cause a lot of harm to the body organs Complication A medical problem that occurs as a result of another illness or disease Heart failure It is a chronic progressive condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body to meet its demands Emphysema Chronic lung condition that causes breathing difficulties Influenza It also known as the flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses It attacks the respiratory system which includes the nose the throat and the lungs Oxygen It is a colourless odourless tasteless gas essential to living organisms It is vital for respiration breathing which is the process that transfers energy from glucose to cells Pneumonia Bacterial c hest infection which affects the tiny air sacs in your lungs called alveoli Pleural effusion Water on the lungs especially in the pleura skin covering the lungs Vaccination Medicine given to reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body s natural defenses to build protection Ventilat ors Ventilators are machines that blow air or air with extra oxygen into your airways and your lungs They are o ften referred to as life support machines and used in intensive care units for patients who cannot breathe on their own

1 From the Toxipedia website in original form Last updated by Toxipedia in 201 1 Dr Steve Gilbert author Introduction Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells that have damaged D NA expression The cancerous cells repeatedly divide displacing normal tissue The cancer or neoplasm may be either benign or malignant a benign cancer stays confined to the tissue of origin while malignant cancer can spread to other organs The secondary growths or metastases are a serious complication to any treatment of the cancerous cells A tumor is any space filling group of cells that may or may not be cancerous Benign growths or tumors are usually noted by adding the ending oma For example adenoma would be a benign growth of the adrenal cortex a hormone producing group of cells nea r the kidney Malignant tumors are noted by adding sarcoma or carcinoma A malignance of the adrenal cortex would be an adenocarcinoma Bone cancer would be osteosarcoma Toxicology informs us about cancer on two accounts First toxicology research p rovided insight into the causes of cancer and likelihood of developing cancer Second many cancer treatments have serious toxicological side effects Cancer treatment must often balance the need to kill the cancerous cells and the need to protect healthy cells Cancer A Short History The oldest descriptions of cancer date back to Egypt at about 1600 B C The so called Edwin Smith Papyrus describes eight cases of what appears to be breast cancer The tumors of the breast were treated by cauterization w ith a tool called the fire drill The first occupational association with cancer was noted in 1700 with the observation that nuns had an elevated incidence of breast cancer In 1775 the English physician and surgeon Percivall Pott made the observation t hat exposure to soot might explain the high incidence of scrotum cancer in chimney sweeps This was the first indication that exposure to chemicals in this case a complex mixture could cause cancer However this new knowledge did not immediately transla te into improved working conditions for chimney sweeps Over 100 years later it was observed that cancer of the scrotum was rare in continental Europe but still high in England possibly due to better hygiene practices in Europe We still have not taken to heart the cancerous consequences of exposure to smoke and tar as ongoing consumption of tobacco products clearly shows Photo chimney sweep in the 1850 s

2 The industrial revolution of the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries brought clear confirmation t hat occupational exposure to chemicals could cause cancer The first indication came from increases in skin and bladder cancers associated with cutting oils and dyes In 1895 bladder cancer was associated with workers in the aniline dye industry Further worker based studies found that exposure to specific chemicals could be responsible for the cancer In 1915 Japanese researchers reported that they could induce skin tumors in animals by repeatedly applying a coal tar solution to the skin of rabbits Thes e early studies subsequently repeated with mice ushered in the scientific investigation of the chemical causes of cancer These studies also initiated the systematic investigation of the adverse health effects of chemicals which in many ways laid the fo undation for the toxicological sciences But chemicals are not the only cause of cancer Marie Curie awarded Nobel Prizes in both physics and chemistry discovered radium in 1898 The green glow of radium fascinated people and many thought it was a cur e for many diseases including cancer The carcinogenicity of radium became tragically apparent whenyoung women developed bone cancer from painting watch dials with radium The use of nuclear weapons by the U S military in World War I I and subsequent deve lopment of the defense and nuclear industries in various countries have raised public awareness of the health consequences of radiationexposure Naturally occurring background radiation as well as our many medical and industrial exposures to radiation i s responsible for some cancers Photo Marie Curie in 1911 More recent research has broadened our understanding of cancer s causes Epidemiology studies of various human populations indicated that inorganic metals such as arsenic and nickel could cause cancer this was subsequently confirmed in animal studies Various hormones are implicated in organ specific cancer such as breast cancer Nutrition and diet also appear to be related to cancer specifically high caloric intake The grain contaminant afl atoxin B 1 is known to cause liver cancer Chemical mixtures or exposure to multiple agents can increase the incidence of cancer for example smoking and asbestos exposure increase the likelihood of lung cancer And finally we are now learning that our genetic makeup increases the likelihood that certain cancers will develop For example breast cancer is linked to specific genes Selected History of Cancer Year Cancer Type Cause 1775 Scrotal Cancer Soot 1822 Skin Cancer Arsenic 1879 Lung Cancer Uranium Mining 1895 Bladder Cancer Aniline Dyes 1902 Skin Cancer X rays

3 Year Cancer Type Cause 1908 Leukemia Filterable Agents 1914 Experimental induction of skin cancers Coal Tar 1928 Experimental induction of skin cancers U V Light Cancer Case Studies Soot In 1775 Percivall Pott observed that there was an increased incidence of scrotum cancer in chimney sweeps and suggested that soot might be the cause This was the first linking of occupational chemical exposure to cancer Unfortunately this understanding was not t ranslated into action and prevention By the late 1890 s scrotal cancer was relatively rare on the European content but still high in England which some suggested was due to poor hygiene failure to remove the soot from the skin resulted in chronic exposu re to the chemicals in soot which resulted in cancer This example recalls the most basic tenets of public health wash your hands or other body parts Scientific investigation of the cancer causing properties of soot took a step forward when Japanese research found that skin tumors developed if coal tar was repeatedly applied to the skin of rabbits In the 1930 s polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were isolated from coal tar and demonstrated to be carcinogenic Despite this evidence millions of people co ntinue to expose themselves to the soot from tobacco and suffer from the resulting lung cancer Benzene Benzene C 6 H 6 is a clear colorless liquid at room temperature that readily evaporates It is derived from petroleum and is widely used in the product ion of other products such as rubber nylon synthetic fiber lubricants glues detergents dyes drugs and pesticides to name just a few Worldwide benzene use and production are measured in the billions of pounds making it one of the top twenty chemi cals in use In the United States benzene is present in gasoline at about 2 but in other countries the amount may be up to 5 Benzene is classified as a human carcinogen Liver enzymes convert benzene to more toxic metabolites this mechanism is thoug ht to be what causes its carcinogenicity Benzene is readily absorbed by inhalation and acute exposure can result in central nervous system effects such as dizziness drowsiness and eventual unconsciousness Chronic exposure to benzene affects the bone m arrow by crippling blood cell production causing anemia which can ultimately result in leukemia At one time benzene was widely used as a solvent resulting in excessive worker exposure it continues to be a significant workplace contaminant Benzene is present in the indoor environment from off gassing of glues synthetic materials and tobacco smoke Smokers can have benzene body burdens ten times that of nonsmokers Because of its widespread use in industry benzene is a common contaminant of hazardous waste and old industrial sites The U S E PA recommends the benzene not exceed 5 ppb

4 parts per billion or 0 005 mg L in drinking water The U S Occupational Health and Safety Administration set a standard of 1 ppm of benzene in the air over an 8 hour perio d with an action level set at 0 5 ppm in an effort to encourage reductions in the workplace environment Other agencies have established even lower standards down to 0 1 ppm benzene in the air Asbestos Asbestos a recognized human carcinogen has a long and curious history Asbestos continues to cause serious human health effects and continues to be the subject of legal action against companies that used or produced it Asbestos is the common name given to a group of six different naturally occurring fib rous minerals that can be separated into long fibers that can be spun and woven The material is strong flexible resistant to heat and most solvents and acids making it a very useful industrial product Knowledge of asbestos goes back to the 2 nd century B C but the first recorded use of the word asbestos was in the 1 st century A D by Pliny the Elder The fire resistant properties of asbestos were recognized early and contributed to its derivation from the Greek sbestos or extinguishable thus a sbestos or inextinguishable The Romans used asbestos to make cremation cloths and lamp wicks and in the Middle Ages knights used asbestos to insulate their suits of armor The use of asbestos increased with the Industrial Revolution and the need for a mater ial to insulate steam boilers such as those in locomotives The first asbestos mine opened in 1879 in Quebec Canada Canada continues to be the world s largest producer of asbestos followed by Russia China Brazil and several other countries In the Un ited States California produces a small amount but the majority of the asbestos used in the United States is imported from Canada Serious lung disease associated with asbestos inhalation was first described in the early 1900 s in England This disease be came known as asbestosis and was fully described in British medical journals in 1924 as young workers died from asbestos exposure By the early 1930 s dose related injury length of time exposed and the latency of response were being well characterized in both Europe and the United States By the mid and late 1930 s the first associations with lung cancer were documented In the 1960 s the consequences of asbestos exposure for many workers in World War I I started to become evident Mesothelioma a cancer of the lining of the lung was found to be almost exclusively associated with asbestos exposure In the United States regulation of asbestos exposure started in the early 1970 s with exposure limits rapidly decreasing as the serious and latent consequences of asbestos exposure became apparent White asbestos or chrysotile was used in thousands of consumer products and is common in many older homes The serious health effects of asbestos exposure have resulted in both regulatory and legal action and many cou ntries have instituted complete bans on asbestos use Radon Radon is another example of a very curious and toxic compound that many of us regularly inhale one hopes in small amounts For those regularly exposed to radon there is an increased risk for lu ng cancer and for those who smoke radon exposure results in a three fold increase in the incidence of lung

5 cancer In the United States it is estimated that indoor radon exposure causes between 7 000 and 30 000 lung cancer related deaths each year second only to tobacco smoking Radon 222 is a colorless and odorless radioactive gas that results from the decay of Radium 226 which is widely distributed in the earth s crust Radon decays with a half life of 3 8 days into solid particles of polonium It is actually the breakdown of polonium that causes cancer polonium sticks to the tissues of the lung and when it decays it releases an alpha particle which damages the D NA of the closest cell Lung diseases possibly related to radon were first reported i n the 1400 s and in 1879 lung cancer was seen in European miners Radon was discovered several years later in 1900 by the German chemist Friedrich Ernst Dorn Regulation of workplace exposure began in the 1950 s and subsequent studies of underground mine wo rkers in Canada Czechoslovakia France Australia Sweden and the United States have allowed researchers to develop very sophisticated models of the cancer causing effects of radon It is difficult to translate these results into the effects of radon on i ndoor home exposure The United States E PA sets an action level of four picocuries per liter p Ci l There are some areas of the United States and Europe with high levels of radon that can enter homes schools or public buildings particularly underground levels In the United States it is estimated that 1 in 15 6 of homes have elevated levels of radon A number of public and private organizations provide information on reducing indoor radon exposure See the References and Additional Information page for links to information on benzene asbestos and radon Genetic Toxicology and the Biology of Cancer Genetic toxicology is the study of the effects of chemical and physical agents on genetic material It includes the study of D NA damage in living c ells that leads to cancer but it also examines changes in D NA that can be inherited from one generation to the next Genetic toxicology although not called that at the time got its start in 1927 when American geneticist Hermann J Muller 1890 1967 dem onstrated that X rays increased the rate of gene mutations and chromosome changes in fruit flies The relevance of genetic toxicology is clearly evident from inheritable diseases such as phenylketonuria an inability to metabolize phenylalanine cystic f ibrosis lung disease sickle cell anemia and Tay Sachs disease Recent advances in molecular biology and genomic sciences are leading to a far greater understanding of the genetic cause of disease and even pointing the way to treatments D NA Mutations To understand cancer it is necessary to explore the cellular changes that turn a normal cell into a malignant cell that repeatedly and uncontrollably divides This transformation occurs when there is genetic damage or an alteration in the structure of a ce ll s D NA D NA short for deoxyribonucleic acid is the coding machinery of life The beauty of D NA is its simplicity The double helix of D NA is made of the compounds adenine A guanine G thymine T and cytosine C These chemicals are bound in long stretches as A T and C G pairs and wrapped in sugar molecules

6 that hold them together Long stretches of these A T and C G combinations form genes which when read produce the proteins that drive our cells Ideally the D NA sequence would not change exc ept in the recombining that occurs during reproduction However D NA damage occurs regularly as part of the cell process and from interaction with both normal cellular chemicals and with toxic chemicals A very robust repair mechanism rapidly and very accurately repairs the D NA damage but if for some reason the D NA is repaired incorrectly a mutation occurs The mutation is a subtle or not so subtle change in the A G C or T that make up the D NA Many of the mutations have no effect some have minor ef fects and a small number have life threatening effects If a mutation occurs in the wrong place a cell can start to divide uncontrollably becoming a malignant cell and causing a cancer If a mutation occurs in our germ line cells the mutation can be pa ssed on to our offspring Mutagens Chemicals that induce mutations in the D NA are called mutagens and when these changes lead to cancer the chemical is called a carcinogen Not all mutagens are carcinogens and not all carcinogens are mutagens In 1946 i t was shown that nitrogen mustards derived from mustard gas first used by the military in 1917 during W WI could induce mutations in the fruit fly and reduce tumor growth in mice Genetic toxicology developed ways to test chemical and physical agents for their mutagenic properties and in the 1970 s Bruce Ames and others developed a cellular based test for genetic mutations This test became known as the Ames assay Sophisticated variations of these tests are now required by many government regulatory agen cies to test chemicals for mutagenicity before they are of approved for use Often it is a metabolite breakdown product of the compound that causes cancer not the original compound Ideally a foreign chemical is made less toxic when metabolized but so metimes a chemical can be made more toxic This more toxic chemical can then interact with cellular D NA or proteins and produce malignant cells This process is called bioactivation It is also possible for a chemical to encourage bioactivation or to accel erate the development of a cancer Many variations of the Ames test that include liver cells were developed to simulate the metabolism of the chemical in the liver and determine if bioactivation would result in mutations Efforts to understand the underly ing biology of cancer are ongoing The genomic sciences are helping to explain why some people are more susceptible to cancer than others We also know that there are many causes of cancer and that we can reduce the likelihood of developing cancer What Causes Cancer We are continuously exposed to a wide range of chemical and physical agents both natural and human generated that may cause cancer Exposure to sunlight background radiation natural and manufactured chemicals even oxygen can damage our D NA and result in cancer Because our knowledge is imperfect there is a great deal of conflicting information on the causes of cancer and what can be done to reduce the risk of developing cancer And we are just beginning to understand how our individual genetic makeup influences the possibility of developing cancer and other genetic based disease

7 Some Known Causes of Cancer Cause Example Lifestyle Tobacco and alcohol consumption diet Ambient environmental exposures Air drinking water Organic chemicals Benzo a pyrene in coal tar Benzene Inorganic chemicals and metals arsenic cadmium nickel Fibers Asbestos Radiation Sunlight ultraviolet radioactive material Drugs Diethylstilbestrol D ES Viruses Epstein Barr A ID S papilloma Genetic Increased likelihood ex breast cancer Lifestyle choices are the cause of many cancers Tobacco consumption probably accounts for between 25 to 40 of all cancer deaths The other major lifestyle choices associated with cancer are alcoholconsumption and diet Alcohol increases the incidence of liver disease and liver cancer Diet has a broad range of effects some good and some not so good Some cooked meats have a higher concentrations of agents that appear to cause cancer howeve r a diet rich in vegetables may reduce the incidence of cancer High caloric intake and high fat consumption may encourage the onset of cancer from other agents Numerous organic chemicals are known or likely carcinogens In the 1930 s benzo a pyrene was isolated from coal tar and shown to cause skin cancer Further investigation revealed an entire class of carcinogenic compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons P AHs Shortly after World War I I it was discovered that azo dyes could also cause ca ncer In the 1960 s naturally occurring contaminants from a grain fungus aflatoxin were found to be a potent liver carcinogen Inorganic chemicals and fibers are also carcinogenic Arsenic is the most serious human carcinogen because of exposure from drinking water Cadmium chromium and nickel are all lung carcinogens The most common lung carcinogen is asbestos which has unique properties making it ideal for many industrial and even home insulation applications It was also used in shipyards and in car brake pads This widespread use resulted in thousands of workers being exposed to asbestos and suffering from a range of lung diseases including cancer Asbestos exposure produces a very unique form of lung cancer called mesothelioma Mesothelioma is caused in part by asbestos fibers inducing a chronic irritation of the lung resulting in an inflammatory response that ultimately causes some cells to become cancerous Hormones which regulate many important bodily functions are also associated with ca ncer One of the first hints of the relationship between hormones and cancers was the observation that nuns had a

8 greater incidence of breast cancer This was due to the nuns not having children Since that time there have been numerous studies on the asso ciation of birth control childbirth and most recently hormone replacement with cancer In males there is ongoing study of hormones and prostate cancer While it is clear that hormones and cancer are related the exact characterization of this relations hip is still unclear We are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of diet and nutrition in reducing the risk of cancer From a toxicological perspective it is important to reduce exposure to agents that increase the risk of cancer Cancer like declining physical and mental ability is related to old age and may even be a natural consequence of the aging process However exposure to cancer causing agents increases the risk or likelihood of developing cancer Cancer Regulatory Standards Nationa l and international agencies have established systems to classify agents according to the likelihood that the agent may cause cancer This is often a difficult process because the information on an agent may be incomplete or inconclusive Data from any hum an epidemiology studies are evaluated first followed by information from animal studies The International Agency for Research on Cancer I AR C has developed one of the most comprehensive classification schemes In this scheme an agent is rated from 1 to 4 based on human and animal data see table below Other classification schemes are in use by the U S E PA National Toxicology Program National Institute of Occupational Health Sciences N IO SH and the State of California I AR C Classification Scheme f or Carcinogenicity of Chemical and Physical Agents Group Evidence Example 1 Carcinogenic to humans Sufficient human data Aflatoxin benzene arsenic formaldehyde 2 A Probably carcinogenic to humans Limited human data Sufficient animal data P CBs styrene oxide creosotes 2 B Possibly carcinogenic to humans Limited or inadequate human data Sufficient animal data Styrene T CD D dioxins lead Mirex 3 Not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans No enough human or animal data Diazepam melamine phenol 4 Probably not carcinogenic to humans Inadequate human data Inadequate animal data Source I AR C Preamble to the I AR C Monographs 2006

9 Government regulatory agencies do not always agree on the classification of cancer causing compounds and there are several different schemes used by different agencies Elaborate animal study protocols are used to determine if an agent may cause cancer Cancer Recommendation and Conclusions While scientists have made great strides in unders tanding the causes of cancer and developing treatments there will always be a risk for developing cancer The likelihood of developing cancer is related to our individual sensitivity and our dose response curve As individuals we can try to be aware of the risks of exposure to suspected carcinogens and take appropriate actions to reduce our exposure but this can be difficult due to a lack of ingredient labeling There must be better labeling of ingredients and easier access to information about chemicals that may be carcinogenic Cancer References and Additional Information European Asian and International Agencies I AR C International Agency for Research on Cancer I AR C World Health Organization W HO Online accessed 0 7 July 2009 I AR C s mission is to coordinate and conduct research on the causes of human cancer the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and to develop scientific strategies for cancer control World Health Organization W HO Cancer Online accessed 07 July 2009 Site has information on international exposure to a wide range of compounds that cause cancer Japan National Cancer Center English Online ac cessed 07 July 2009 Site has information on the treatment and cause of cancer for Japan Japanese or English versions available Australia Sun Smart Online accessed 07 July 2009 An Australian site that focuses on skin cancer and its primary cause the sun Australia Cancer Council Victoria Online accessed 07 July 2009 The Cancer Council Victoria is an independent volunteer based charity whose mission is to lead coordinate implement and evaluate action to minimize the human cost of cancer for all Victorians Asbestos Institute Online institute ca accessed 07 July 2009 The Asbestos Institute is dedicated to promoting the safe use of asbestos in Canada and throughout the world French and English Cancer Help U K Online accessed 07 July 2009

1 P IP Digest U ND ER ST AN DI NG C AN CE R What is Cancer and Types of Cancer This P IP Digest provides key concepts about cancer explains how it develops and spreads and describes the major types of cancer Key Concepts Cancer initiation Cancer progression Cancer types Related P IP Digests Understanding Cancer Tumour Grading and Cancer Staging Understanding Cancer Hallmarks of Cancer What is Cancer 1 Cancer is a collection of related diseases where some cells divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues Cancer can start almost anywhere in the body Normally our cells grow and divide to form new cells as our body needs them When cells grow old or become damaged they die and new cells take their place When cancer develops however this orderly process breaks down Cells become more and more abnormal Old or damaged cells survive when they should die and new cells form when they are not needed These extra cells can form growths called tumours Cancerous tumours are malignant which means they can invade nearby tissues In addition as these tumours grow some cancer cells can break off and travel to distant places in the body throug h the blood or the lymph system and form new tumours far from the original Solid tumours are masses of tissue named for the type of cells they formed from Liquid tumours such as leukemias are cancers of the blood and bone marrow Unlike malignant tumours benign tumours do not spread into nearby tissues and often don t grow back when they are removed Benign tumours can sometimes be quite large and in the case of benign brain tumours can be life threatening 1 Adapted from cancer understanding what is cancer

2 P IP Digest Differences between Cancer Cells and Norma l Cells Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways that allow them to grow out of control and become invasive Unlike normal cells that mature into very distinct types with specific functions cancer cells are less specialized which helps them di vide without stopping Cancer cells ignore signals that would otherwise stop them dividing or that begin the process known as programmed cell death or apoptosis Cancer cells influence surrounding normal cells molecules and blood vessels an area known as the microenvironment For instance cancer cells can induce nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply tumours with oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products Cancer cells often evade or hide from the immune system that would norma lly remove them They can even co opt the immune system to help them grow and stay alive How Cancer Arises Cancer is a genetic disease that is it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function especially how they grow and divide Cancer can be inherited can arise because of errors that occur as cells divide can be caused when D NA is damaged by exposure to environmental factors including chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet radiation from the sun can be caused by epigenetic alterations which affect the behaviour of genes without affecting the genetic structure itself Epigenetic marks switch genes on or off in response to diet stress prenatal nutrition and a wide range of other environmental influences Some epigenetic changes can be passed from one generation to the next Each person s cancer involves a unique combination of genetic changes As a cancer continues to grow additional changes occur A single tumour may contain many different genetic variations In general cancer cells exhibit more genetic changes than normal cells Some changes may be the result of the cancer rather than its cause Drivers of Cancer The genetic origins of cancer tend to arise in two main types of genes oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes These mutations are sometimes called drivers of cancer Altered oncogenes stop regulating cell division allowing cells to grow and survive when they should not Tumour suppressor genes which would normally stop cancer are altered and enable cells to divide uncontrollably When Cancer Spreads In metastasis c ancer cells break away from where they first formed primary cancer travel through the blood or lymph system and form new tumours metastatic tumours in other parts of the body Under a microscope metastatic cancer

3 P IP Digest cells generally share molecular feat ures with the original cancer including specific chromosome changes For this reason the original and metastatic tumours are considered the same type of cancer For instance breast cancer that metastasizes in the lung is metastatic breast cancer not lung cancer Metastatic tumours can severely damage how the body functions Most people who die of cancer die of metastatic disease Most treatments for metastatic cancers are designed to relieve symptoms and control the size of tumours and their further spread But reducing cancer deaths requires curing metastatic disease outright Tissue Changes that Are Not Cancer Not every change in the body s tissues is cancer though many may develop into cancer if they are not treated The diagram on the next page shows the progression of cellular changes that may lead to cancer Hyperplasia occurs when cells within a tissue divide faster than normal and build up or proliferate The cells and the way the tissue is organized look normal under a microscope Hyperplasi a can be caused by chronic irritation or several other factors Dysplasia is more serious than hyperplasia Dysplasia also involves a buildup of extra cells but the cells look abnormal and there are changes in how the tissue is organized In general the more abnormal the cells and tissue look the greater the chance that cancer will form Some types of dysplasia may need to be monitored or treated For example an abnormal skin mole called a dysplastic may turn into melanoma An even more serious condition is carcinoma in situ Carcinoma in situ is not invasive cancer because the abnormal cells do not spread beyond the original tissue But because some carcinomas in situ become invasive they are usually treated Cancer Progression Source 6 Cancer progression from NI H png

4 P IP Digest Types of Cancer 2 There are more than 100 types of cancer Cancers are usually named for the organs or tissues where they form For example lung cancer starts in lung cells and brain cancer in brain cells Cancers also may be described by the type of cell that formed them such as an epithelial cell or a squamous cell Carcinomas are the most common type of cancer They are formed by epithelial cells which are the cells that cover the inside and outside surfaces of the body There are many types of epithelial cells which often have a column like shape when viewed under a m icroscope Carcinomas that begin in different epithelial cell types have specific names Adenocarcinoma forms in epithelial cells that produce fluids or mucus Tissues with this type of epithelial cell are sometimes called glandular tissues Most cancers of the breast colon and prostate are adenocarcinomas Basal cell carcinoma begins in the lower or basal base layer of the epidermis or outer layer of skin Squamous cell carcinoma forms in squamous cells which grow just beneath the outer surface of t he skin They also line many other organs including the stomach intestines lungs bladder and kidneys Under a microscope Squamous cells look flat like fish scales Squamous cell carcinomas are sometimes called epidermoid carcinomas Transitional cel l carcinoma forms in a type of epithelial tissue called transitional epithelium or urothelium This tissue made up of many layers of epithelial cells lines the bladder ureters a part of the kidneys called the renal pelvis and other organs Some cancers of the bladder ureters and kidneys are transitional cell carcinomas Sarcomas are cancers that form in bone and soft tissues including muscle fat blood vessels lymph vessels and fibrous tissue such as tendons and ligaments Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer Common soft tissue sarcomas include leiomyosarcoma Kaposi sarcoma malignant fibrous histiocytoma liposarcoma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans Leukemias are cancers that begin in the blood forming tissue of the bone marrow also called liquid tumours Large numbers of abnormal white blood cells leukemia cells and leukemic blast cells build up in the blood and bone marrow crowding out normal blood cells and making it harder for the body to deliver oxygen control bleeding and fight infections The four common categories of leukemia are based on how quickly they progress acute or chronic and the type of blood cell they start in lymphoblastic or myeloid Lymphoma begins in lymphocytes T cells or B cells These diseas e fighting white blood cells are part of the immune system With lymphoma abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes and vessels as well as in other organs There are two main types of lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma People with this disease have abnormal lymphocytes called Reed Sternberg cells These cells usually form from B cells 2 Adapted from cancer understanding what is cancer

5 P IP Digest Non Hodgkin lymphoma This large group of cancers can grow quickly or slowly and can form from B or T cells Multiple myeloma is a cancer that begins in plasma cells which are another type of immune cell Abnormal plasma cells called myeloma cells build up in the bone marrow and form tumours in bones all through the body Multiple myeloma is also called plasma cell myeloma or K ahler disease Melanoma begins in cells that become melanocytes which make melanin the pigment that gives skin its color Most melanomas form on the skin but they can also form in other pigmented tissues such as the eye intraocular melanoma Brain a nd spinal cord tumours have different types These tumours are named for the type of cell in which they form and for the place where the tumour first forms For example an astrocytic tumour begins in star shaped brain cells called astrocytes which help k eep nerve cells healthy Brain tumours can be benign not cancerous or malignant cancerous But because of the confined space of the skull even benign brain tumours can be life threatening Germ cell tumours are a type of tumour that begins in the cells that give rise to sperm or eggs These tumours can occur almost anywhere in the body and can be either benign or malignant Neuroendocrine tumours form from cells that release hormones into the blood in response to a signal from the nervous system These tumours which may make higher than normal amounts of hormones can cause many different symptoms Neuroendocrine tumours may be benign or malignant Carcinoid tumours are a type of neuroendocrine tumour They are slow growing tumours in the gastrointesti nal system most often in the rectum and small intestine Carcinoid tumours may spread to the liver or other sites in the body and may secrete substances such as serotonin or prostaglandins causing carcinoid syndrome Moving Away from Anatomically base d Cancer Classifications On May 9 2016 the World Health Organization W HO published an official reclassification of Tumour Types of the Central Ner vous System which integrates molecular information with histology so that cancers can be more accurately diagnosed and treated Since the advent of new technology and capabilities for genomic sequencing molecular studies on brain tumours have revealed the vast diversity of genetic and epigenetic alterations that exist between brain tumours This biological heterogeneity often means tumours that may at first blush appear to be the same may require a different approach to treatment as well as the converse i e tumours that may look different under the microscope may have common molecular alterations Further studies have also shown that molecular signatures in tumour cells can define different groups of brain tumour types with distinctive characteristics and that analyzing a tumour for mutations or deletions in certain genes or regions of chromosomes c an provide a deeper level of understanding of each tumour s make up Thus it was critical that molecular data be integrated into traditional histopathology approaches to reclassify brain tumour types more effectively This moves the brain tumour field further into the era of precision medicine Abstracted from tumor information understanding brain tumors tumor types acoustic neuroma

What is Cancer by U C Davis Child Life

2 3 I am a healthy cell I am so small you can t even see me I live inside the human body and work with other healthy cells to keep the body working well I really like having a job in the body I m going to take you for a ride today Come with me

4 5 When someone has cancer they have unhealthy cells in their body These unhealthy cells are also called cancer cells Cancer cells don t have a job to do in the body Look over there you can see some cancer cells They look different than healthy cells

6 7 Cancer cells can grow and grow They can get in the way of me and other healthy cells doing our jobs to keep the body working well

8 9 Sometimes cancer cells clump together This is called a tumor A tumor can stay in one spot or can go to other parts of the body

10 11 Doctors and their teams help people with cancer They aren t sure why some people get cancer but they do know it is not like a cold you can catch from someone else

12 13 When someone has cancer there are ways to try and make it go away Chemotherapy is a medicine that goes after the cancer cells Chemotherapy can hurt some healthy cells by accident If it hurts healthy hair cells this may cause a person s hair to fall out The good news is that the healthy cells and hair will grow back

14 15 Some people with cancer may need surgery Surgery is when the doctors try and take out as many cancer cells as they can from the body Goodbye cancer cells

16 17 Other people with cancer need to have radiation Radiation aims high powered energy on the part of the body with cancer This can shrink tumors and get rid of cancer cells

18 19 Chemotherapy surgery and radiation all help to get rid of cancer cells or slow down their growth Any of these steps can take time and a person may feel tired or be a little uncomfortable If things go as planned the cancer cells get cleared out This makes room for me and other healthy cells to do our jobs again and we really like helping the body work well

20 21 Thanks for coming along with me today I hope you have learned more about cancer It can be hard to understand and it is normal to have questions Talking to your parents or other adults about your questions can be helpful

22 23 Also you may have a lot of different feelings about cancer and that is okay Sharing how you feel and finding things you like to do may help

28 29 Healthy cells know just what to do They work together a mighty crew Healthy cells have a plan A place to be and a job to man Cancer cells are plain confused No plan no map no work to do They grow too fast and take up space Cancer cells clog up the place To stop the spread of cancer cells We need help to keep the body well Doctors have many tricks To stop the spread to find a fix Chemotherapy is just one Way to get this tough job done Medicine targets cancer cells And works to make the body well Surgery is another way That doctors use to cut away Tumors or groups of cancer cells That make the body feel unwell Radiation can help stop the spread It uses energy instead To zap cancer cells away To help the body feel okay Ask your questions Feel you feels Take a deep breath Eat a healthy meal There s so much to know But know you re not alone There s so much to know But know you re not alone Healthy Cells and Cancer Cells By Brad Steiger M T B C
